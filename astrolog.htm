<p class=FA>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=A>Documentation for Astrolog version 7.10 (October 2020):</p>

<p class=A>This file contains a complete list of all the features available in
Astrolog, and documentation on how to use each option. The file is divided into
nine sections:</p>

<p class=A>1) <b><a href="#summary">Summary</a>:</b> A summary of the program
and a list of its main features.</p>

<p class=A>2) <b><a href="#switch">Command Switch List</a>:</b> A summary of
all features which are accessed via command line switches and parameters is
listed, along with the single key press commands that can be given to a
windowed command line version of the program (such as the X Windows version) to
change the display in various ways.</p>

<p class=A>3) <b><a href="#command">Command Switch Description</a>:</b> The
list of command switches and keys is repeated, but after each option is given a
full description of the details of the feature.</p>

<p class=A>4) <b><a href="#main">Text Display</a>:</b> Descriptions of things
that appear in Astrolog text displays are described. This consists of
describing how to enter chart information into the program, and how to
interpret what is seen in the standard main display.</p>

<p class=A>5) <b><a href="#file">Files</a>:</b> Details of default settings, for
compile time options and in the default configuration file, are described,
along with using Astrolog files in general.</p>

<p class=A>6) <b><a href="#graphics">Graphics</a>:</b> Next is a description of
the different graphic chart displays and how they are organized, for versions
such as MS Windows and X Windows. (Looking for a quick display to prove
Astrolog was worth downloading or compiling? With graphics try: astrolog -Xi -Xn
-XG!)</p>

<p class=A>7) <b><a href="#windows">Windows Version</a>:</b> Then is discussed
Astrolog for MS Windows, and a description of the menu and dialog interface it
offers.</p>

<p class=A>8) <b><a href="#express">AstroExpressions</a>:</b> This section
describes AstroExpressions, which are programmable customizations that dont
require recompiling the program.</p>

<p class=A>9) <b><a href="#compile">Compiling</a>:</b> Finally is a section on
compiling Astrolog if you have the source code files, as opposed to an
executable ready to run, as well as how to compile and run Astrolog on the
Macintosh.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=command>DESCRIPTION OF EACH COMMAND SWITCH</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Astrolog allows command line switches to be invoked with either the
leading dash (-) standard to Unix users, or a leading slash (/) that PC
users are more accustomed to. Not only that, but the leading character is
actually optional. For example, the command astrolog -i chartfile -R -u -U -Z
-Xs 300 -Xi -XB can be done as astrolog /i chartfile /r /u /U /Z /Xs 300, or
can be abbreviated as just astrolog i chartfile R u U Z Xs 300 Xi XB. (This
is subject to a couple of minor limitations, in that one can't have numeric switches
like -1 follow a -R restriction list of numbers, since the -1 will be parsed
as a number.)</p>

<p class=A>Many switches in their standard form are technically a toggle instead
of a set for the particular feature in question. For example, astrolog -v -g
-g will only result in the -v chart being printed. An aspect grid won't,
because the first -g turned it on while the second -g turned it back off again.
This can be useful, in say the -e everything switch. If you want all of
Astrologs charts except the astro-graph, you can do astrolog -e -L, where
the -e turns everything on and the -L turns the astro-graph chart (already on
because of -e) back off. In another example, to get a chart with only the fixed
stars in it, one can do astrolog -R0 -RU, where the -R0 restricts everything,
and the -RU unrestricts all the stars. The various -X switches which set a mode
in graphics are also toggles. A combination like -Xr -Xr which with one
instance will just go into reverse video mode, will remain out of it because
the first -Xr put you in and the second toggled you back out.</p>

<p class=A>Command switch flags may actually be forced on or off regardless of
their current setting with special character prefixes. Many switches (such as
-s) represent on/off flags and their setting is toggled when the switch is encountered.
However, that alone doesn't allow one to force the setting to be a value,
because we don't know if it needs to be toggled or not. Therefore, prefixing
any flag switch with '_' will reset its state even if already off, while
prefixing with '=' will always make it on. For example, putting _s on a
command line will always set tropical zodiac, while =s will always set
sidereal. The standard '-' and '/' prefixes, along with no prefix at all,
always toggle the current setting. This is useful for configuration files where
we want to set various flags to particular values. Theres one more obscure
switch prefix of ':', which doesn't affect the setting at all, but still
affects any subsetting parameters. For example, :I 80 won't affect the
interpretation setting at all, but will still set the default screen width to
80 columns. That is slightly simpler than the -I 80 -I double toggle that
would have to be done to do such a thing otherwise.</p>

<p class=A>The various static help listings that may be generated, such as the
lists from -H, -HO, -HI, and so on, may be combined with each other and even
the actual charts. For convenience the program will terminate right away and
not prompt for chart info if the only thing specified is one of the tables,
e.g. just -H will print the help list and exit, but -H -i file -g will
print the help list followed by an aspect grid chart.</p>

<p class=A>In the command list below, greater than/less than symbols ('&lt;'
and '&gt;') are used to denote a command switch parameter to be replaced by the
appropriate value, brackets ('[' and ']') are used to denote an optional
parameter, and commas are used to separate either/or choices. For example, the
specification of the -I switch is -I [&lt;columns&gt;], meaning that one can
specify the -I switch, followed a parameter for the number of screen columns,
but that this extra parameter is optional. The specification of the -Xs switch
is -Xs &lt;100,200,300,400&gt;, meaning it can be used as either -Xs 100, -Xs
200, -Xs 300, or -Xs 400. An ellipsis ('..') generally refers to a
variable length list of values or an abbreviation for something already
indicated in related switches.</p>

<p class=A>Correct parsing of strings is done on the command line (and in files
since they are technically command lines) in addition to when the user is being
prompted for data within the program. For example, to do the natal chart for
the alt.astrology newsgroup using the -qa switch, one may enter the intuitive -qa
Jul 29 1991ad 6:23pm -10 151e13 33s52. The items may be entered in simpler numeric
forms as well, such as just -qa 7 29 1991 18:23 -10 -151:13 -33:52.</p>

<p class=A>Any command switch that takes an index number as a parameter may
have it specified by its actual name instead of a harder to remember value. For
example, the switch sequence -c 1 -R 6 -A 5 -F 7 10 0 may also be entered as
the more understandable -c Koch -R Jupiter -A Sextile -F Saturn Capricorn 0.
Any string may be abbreviated to its first three characters, or any longer
substring as long as they all match. Some stars (along with Vulcan and
Vulkanus) have the same first three characters, so they need longer substrings
to be unambiguous. Aspects should be based on their formal abbreviations, e.g.
ssx instead of sem for Semisextile.</p>

<p class=Section2>Astrolog (version 7.10) command switches:</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-H:</span> Display this help list.</p>

<p class=B>This option displays a list of all standard command switches. One
can also use -? to display this list. Note that PC users are accustomed to
seeing command switches with a leading slash / instead of a dash -. To
accommodate this, the list will display all the switches with a leading / instead
of a -, if the program has been compiled for a PC. On Unix and other systems
they will be displayed with the standard leading -.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Hc:</span> Display program credits and copyrights.</p>

<p class=B>This help switch displays a full page of credits, listing the names
of those who programmed Astrolog or parts of it, and important copyright
information and other legal items. Every time the command line version of the program
is invoked, the -Hc switch is mentioned to use to see this info.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-HC:</span> Display names of zodiac signs and houses.</p>

<p class=B>The -HC switch will display a list of the 12 signs of the zodiac,
and the 12 houses, listing their standard and traditional names. This is
similar to switches like -HO or -HA below, in that it displays lists of things
(objects, aspects, or in this case the signs) that Astrolog uses in its charts.
This switch will also include Esoteric Astrology information, in that for each
sign, listed will be the Rays associated with the sign, the signs standard
exoteric planetary rulers, the signs esoteric rulers, the signs Hierarchical
rulers, the planet exalted in the sign, the exoteric detriments in the sign,
and the planet that falls in the sign.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-HO:</span> Display available planets and other
celestial objects.</p>

<p class=B>Similar to the -HA option below, the -HO option will list the
planets and other celestial objects used by the program, and their index numbers
as recognized by the -R switch restrictions. This list will also show the
zodiac signs that planets rule, have their detriment in, are exalted in, and have
their fall i.e. are debilitated in. Stars are printed in the list along with
their zodiac position, ecliptic latitude, and brightness values. Note that this
list shows only those items that aren't restricted when its displayed. If you
want to show all 90 objects regardless of restriction status, then use the -R1
switch to activate them all and combine it with -HO. This switch will also
include Esoteric Astrology information, in that for each planet, listed will be
the signs the planet esoterically rules, the signs the planet Hierarchically
rules, and the Ray associated with the planet.</p>

<p class=B>The object list table will include the list of additional stars if
the Show All Stars setting (-XU switch) is on. The extra stars will be in a
separate list after the main list of objects. For each star it will show its scientific
nomenclature abbreviation (in which something like alCyg means Alpha Cygni),
the current zodiac position and latitude of the star, its magnitude or
brightness, and finally its traditional or common name (if any). Rows will be
colored dark gray (for dim stars magnitude 4.0 or above), light gray, or white
(for bright stars below magnitude 2.0).</p>

<p class=B>Concerning objects the program includes, Astrolog supports the
position of Earth in the same way it does other planets. Earth is object number
0, placed before all other objects. Earth is restricted by default, which means
that in heliocentric charts, Earth needs to be unrestricted to see it. If Earth
is unrestricted in a geocentric chart, it will be the heliocentric position of
the Earth (i.e. directly opposite the Sun). Similar logic will be applied
whenever the central object is unrestricted (with an unrestricted Sun in a
heliocentric chart being the geocentric position of the Earth, i.e. opposite
the Earth).</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can do the position of Lilith, often called the Dark Moon.
This Lilith is the point in space of one focus of the Moons elliptical orbit
around the Earth (Earth itself being in the other of the two), and not the
asteroid (i.e. 1181 Lilith) or hypothetical planet by the same name. Lilith
is object number 18 in Astrolog, and in graphics charts its glyph is a small
circle with a forward slash through it. If preferred, one can use the -YXG
glyph selection switch (described later) to choose the European version of
the glyph which is like the glyph for the Moon but smaller and flipped
horizontally. The -b ephemeris files switch setting needs to be in effect to
get Liliths positions.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can do the position of the Part of Fortune, which is a
derived object determined by the formula (Asc-Sun+Moon). This formula may be
reversed (i.e. Asc+Sun-Moon) for night charts, which Astrolog defines as when
the Sun is in houses 1-6. The Part of Fortune is object number 19 in Astrolog,
and its graphics glyph is a circle with an X through it, like a treasure X
marking the spot. The Part of Fortune is normally placed at 0 ecliptic latitude,
however if the 3D houses setting is on then the same formula used to derive it
will be applied to set its ecliptic latitude as well.</p>

<p class=B>Also, Astrolog can do the position of the Vertex, which is where the
ecliptic intersects the prime vertical in the Western half of the celestial
sphere. This is object number 20 in Astrolog, and its graphics glyph is a cross
with its four endpoints split.</p>

<p class=B>Finally, Astrolog can do the position of the East Point, often
called the Equatorial Ascendant, which is technically the same as the
position of the Ascendant at the equator for the time in question. This is
object number 21 in Astrolog, and its glyph is a simple EP abbreviation.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-HA:</span> Display available aspects, their angles,
and present orbs.</p>

<p class=B>The -HA command switch gives a list of all 18 supported aspects,
their abbreviations as used in the aspect grids, their angles, and their orbs.
It will list the number of each aspect in addition to all the other info (e.g.
conjunct = 1, opposition = 2, etc.) so one can see what number to pass to the
-A switch when changing the number of aspects used. Finally, it will print a
brief description of what each aspect glyph looks like. This is useful if one
doesn't know what aspects the various symbols in the graphic displays are
referring to. If the parallel aspects mode is active, then this will instead
list the parallel aspects, namely parallel and contraparallel.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-HF:</span> Display names of astronomical
constellations.</p>

<p class=B>This will display a text table of all the constellations, listing
their traditional names, their astronomical abbreviations as used in the
graphics above, their English meanings, and even their genitive or possessive
form (e.g. Lyra is the name of the constellation, but the star Vega in it is
called Alpha Lyrae).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-HS:</span> Display information about planets in the
solar system.</p>

<p class=B>This is a another static table which will display some astronomical
information about the planets (and Earths Moon) in a simple form. For each
planet is shown its distance from the Sun (or Earth) in Astronomical Units
(AU), its orbital period in Earth years, its diameter relative to the Earth
(Earth being 1), its rotational period (i.e. day) in hours, its mass relative
to the Earth (Earth being 1), its average density with respect to water (water
being 1), the tilt of its axis with respect to its orbit, and finally the
number of primary moons or satellites it has. This table also includes Chiron
and the four asteroids, the lunar nodes, and the Uranians, at least for the distance
from Sun and length of year fields (and diameter field for the asteroids).
Finally this table will include star objects if theyre unrestricted, in which the
Distance column will measure light years (instead of Astronomical Units as is
done for planets) which is a factor of about 63000.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-H7:</span> Display information about the seven
esoteric Rays.</p>

<p class=B>Information about the seven Rays used in Esoteric Astrology is
available with this switch. Each Ray is listed, along with its name in
esotericism, and the aspect of will that Ray covers. The signs associated with
each Ray will be printed (by default each Ray is associated with exactly three
signs), and the planets associated with each Ray. Finally is printed the slice
value of the Ray, which is the count of signs associated with that Ray, each
proportioned by the number of other Rays associated with that sign. For example,
Ray 5 is associated with Leo (along with Ray 1), Sagittarius (along with Rays 4
and 6), and Aquarius (only Ray 5). Therefore Ray 5s slice value is 1/2 + 1/3 +
1/1 = 1.83.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-HI:</span> Display meanings of signs, houses,
planets, and aspects.</p>

<p class=B>This will display the general meanings of each sign, each house,
each planet, and each aspect, on the screen. This shows more or less the
database the program uses to base its interpretations on (see the -I switch
setting for charts later).</p>

<p class=N><span class=S>-He:</span> Display all tables together (-Hc-H-Y-HX-HC-HO-HA-HF-HS-H7-HI).</p>

<p class=B>This switch will print out all 11 of Astrologs static table help
listings, similar to what -e does for actual charts. Specifically, this will
show the -Hc copyright screen, the -H switch list, the -Y obscure switch list,
the -HX graphics key press list, the -HC sign and house list, the -HO object
list, the -HA aspect list, the -HF constellation list, the -HS planet
information list, the -H7 esoteric Ray list, and the -HI core interpretation
list, for over 600 lines of informational output.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Q:</span> Prompt for more command switches after
display finished.</p>

<p class=B>Usually when Astrolog finishes printing the specified chart or
charts, or when we leave a graphics screen mode, the program will terminate.
However, sometimes one wants to display or work with lots of charts or options,
which would normally cause them to have to invoke the program over and over
again from their shell, using many processes, and can be slow loading over and
over from a slow disk. Auto-termination is also bad when automatically starting
up the program in an X window or DOS box - once the program finishes, the
container will exit right away too, not allowing reading of the text charts.
The -Q switch causes the program to enter a looping mode environment where
(after the first chart is displayed) the user will automatically be prompted to
enter a new set of command switches (using the no SWITCHES interface described
later) which will be processed. This will go on and the program will run until
you enter . on a line for the switches to really terminate it.</p>

<p class=B>Program errors which normally cause Astrolog to exit right away,
will (unless fatal errors) return the user back to this outer loop. Whats
more is that being in the loop doesn't cause all the minor program variables to
be reset every time. The main things like what info to use and what charts to
display must be specified each time, but minor modes (such as the present -x
harmonic factor) won't, so say specify -x 5 once, and you will be casting fifth
harmonic charts until you specify otherwise or exit the loop, not having to
include -x each time.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Q0:</span> Like -Q but prompt for additional switches
on startup.</p>

<p class=B>This is just like -Q above except that the user will first be
prompted for command switches right upon entering the program. Note that these
will be in addition to whatever else was on the command line where the -Q0
itself was specified. This is mostly useful when running on a Windows system
(see later) where one can have -Q0 as a default switch to pass to the program.
Upon activation, the user will be in a loop with Astrolog asking for switches
right away before proceeding to generate or prompt for any chart information.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-M &lt;1-48&gt;:</span> Run the specified command
switch macro.<br>
<span class=S>-M0 &lt;1-48&gt; &lt;string&gt;:</span> Define the specified
command switch macro.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog has a feature to run switch macros, or a whole command
line with one small switch. The -M switch takes one parameter, which is the
number of the macro to run. When encountered, the switches it represents will
be processed. This is similar to loading in a generic command file with -i,
except macros are limited to one command line. Macros however don't require
separate files, and may even call command files themselves with -i.</p>

<p class=B>The switch -M0 is the option that defines a macro. It takes two
parameters: the index of the macro to define, and a string representing the
command line to assign to it. (The command string probably needs to be in
quotes to ensure its treated as one parameter to -M0, instead of many items
which will get processed right away.) There are 48 macro slots available to
define or run. Macros may do anything and even call or define other macros. Its
possible to get in an infinite loop if you make a macro (or command file) call
or load itself, which will make the program terminate with some unusual error.</p>

<p class=B>Macros are powerful and their uses are nearly endless. They can be
defined in the astrolog.as config file for your most common switch sequences, and
are designed to prevent things such as batch files that would have to be
created otherwise. Suppose you often want to see the transits of outer planets
only to the house cusps in your natal chart for the current month. The command
line for this is -i yourchart -tn -RT0 6 7 8 9 10 -R0 -RC -C. You can assign
this to the tenth macro slot with: -M0 10 -i yourchart -tn -RT0 jup sat ura
nep plu -R0 -RC -C. That line can be put in your astrolog.as and you can do
this months transits by just typing astrolog -M 10. Heres another example:
Suppose you want a feature to bring up the chart of the spouse of whoevers
chart you are viewing at any time. You can define a special macro, say in slot
5, in each of your chart info files which does a -i on the file of their
spouse, or does nothing if theyre unmarried. Now when in graphics mode, you
can press 'F5' anytime and Astrolog will bring up the spouses chart! You could
define a bunch of macros to set various color sets or aspect orbs and switch
among them quickly using the function keys. You could even make a simple chart
database by having each chart file load the next one in sequence in some macro,
and then cycle through your charts by running that macro in a -Q switch loop or
from the graphics screen.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-M[2-4][0] &lt;strings&gt;:</span> Define macro(s) to
run when chart calculated.</p>

<p class=B>The -M2, -M3, and -M4 switches allow different calculation settings
to be used for different rings in a bi-wheel, tri-wheel, or quad-wheel chart.
The switches take 2, 3, or 4 string parameters respectively, and each string is
a command line that gets automatically applied before calculating the planet
positions for that ring. If the switch is invoked as -M20, -M30, or -M40 with
an extra 0, then it takes one final parameter for a command line to run at
the very end, which can restore settings to default values for subsequent use
of the program. With this feature you can do things such as have a heliocentric
chart and a geocentric chart displayed at the same time. You can even do things
such as (assuming all calculation methods are compiled into the program) have
one wheel with planets computed via Swiss Ephemeris, another by the old Placalc
ephemeris, and a third by the very old Matrix formulas, to compare their
accuracy side by side.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Y:</span> Display help list of less commonly used
command switches.</p>

<p class=B>This displays a list of available command switches, like the -H
option but showing only less common switches that would clutter things up if
they were in the main list, and are usually only specified in configuration
files. Hence almost all of those switches begin with 'Y'.</p>

<p class=Section2>Switches which determine the type of chart to display:</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-v:</span> Display list of object positions (chosen by
default).</p>

<p class=B>This is just a formal specification for the standard chart listing
of the planetary positions. One will get this chart by default if they don't specify
any other chart types, and they will get it along with everything else in the
-e option (see below). Although it isn't necessary, it must be included if one
wants this type of chart to be displayed along with some of the other chart
types described below.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-v0:</span> Like -v but express velocities relative to
average speed.</p>

<p class=B>This switch is like -v except that it modifies planet velocities slightly.
The -v switch chart normally expresses velocity values as an absolute quantity
in degrees per day that the object appears to have moved through the zodiac.
That means outer planets will generally always have lower values, e.g. although
a velocity of 0.01 degrees/day for fast moving Mercury means its about to turn
retrograde, the same velocity value is normal for slow moving Pluto. Because it
is useful to know when a planet is about to change direction, the -v0 switch
will divide the actual velocity values by how fast each planet moves with
respect to the Sun. That means all planets will have an average relative velocity
value of 1.0, and in all cases a velocity of 2.0 means the planet is moving
twice as fast as normal, and one of 0.01 means the planet is about to turn
retrograde.</p>

<p class=B>Star velocities are accurate, and will be different for different
stars based on their individual (very slow) proper motions. They will also vary
for geocentric charts, because Earths orbit around the Sun produces a minor
parallax effect which can cause stars to appear retrograde at times. However, star
velocities wont be affected by the -v0 switch when the sidereal zodiac is in
effect, because in the sidereal zodiac the average speed of a star is 0 since
theres no precession, and as a result average speed cant be computed since
you cant divide by zero.</p>

<p class=B>Note: The -v0 switch which expresses planetary velocities relative
to average speed has a known incompatibility will cause some applying vs.
separating aspect orbs to be inverted, i.e. displayed as applying when the
reverse is actually true or vice versa. This affects aspect grids and aspect
lists (-ga, -ma, and -D charts, but not the -T transit influence charts). That
is because velocities are used to determine applying vs. separating to see if
one planet is overtaking another. The issue comes with the program thinking
that, for example, Pluto moving 2 times faster than normal will soon overtake
Mars, slightly ahead of it in the zodiac and moving half normal speed. When the
values are expressed as absolute speed, its apparent that the outer planet
Pluto always moves much slower than the more inner planet Mars even when Mars
is moving half normal speed. This issue is not likely to come up much since
only explicitly combining -v0 with -ga, -ma, or -D will cause a problem.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-w [&lt;rows&gt;]:</span> Display chart in a graphic
house wheel format.</p>

<p class=B>Display of the chart in a nice wheel format is supported using the
-w switch. (If one of the houses gets too full of planets, the planet will be
put at the beginning of the next house.) The same chart header information as
is at the top of the standard -v chart is printed in the middle of the wheel.
Some information in addition to this is shown, which is: (1) the day of the
week that the date falls on, (2) the Universal Time (UT) of the time of the
chart being cast (like UTC/GMT in the 24 hour clock), (3) the sidereal time for
the chart cast, where sidereal time is vaguely similar to UT except 0:00 for it
is approximately when 0 Aries crosses the meridian, as opposed to when the Sun
crosses the Nadir for UT, (4) whether the zodiac system is set to tropical or
sidereal, and whether the planetary positions are geocentric, heliocentric, or
centered around some other body, and (5) the Julian day corresponding to the
date and time of the chart. This chart will automatically exclude a house
object from being listed if its position is the same as the cusp composing the
wheel.</p>

<p class=B>Note that this switch takes an optional parameter to specify the
size in text rows of each house printed. By default this is four, but one may
increase (realize this will make the chart require more than 24 lines to print)
or decrease this value to their preference. The parameter may range from 0 to
10, and with this you can nicely generate a text wheel chart with all 89
objects in it, without overflowing all the houses. The number 0 means to
automatically size to cover the house with the largest number of objects in it
(houses will be printed with at least 4 rows, and wont autosize until a 5th
object is present in a house).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-w0 [..]:</span> Like -w but reverse order of objects
in houses 4..9.</p>

<p class=B>In the -w text wheel option, the objects in each house are printed
from top to bottom in order from earliest in the house to latest. This looks
good except for in houses 5..8 where this would appear backwards (e.g. a planet
having just entered the 6th house from the 5th would be displayed right under
the Descendant.) Therefore the objects from houses 4 through 9 are reversed and
printed in order from bottom to top, making a more flowing looking wheel chart.
If however, one always wants each house to be filled from its top to bottom
regardless of which house, replace the -w with the -w0 switch</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-g:</span> Display aspect and midpoint grid among
planets.</p>

<p class=B>Aspects and midpoint display are supported: Invoke as astrolog -g
and a rectangular grid showing the midpoint locations for each planet, and
showing if any aspects are present and how accurate they are, is displayed. The
planets are labeled down the main diagonal of the grid, with the aspects to the
lower left and the midpoints in the upper right. This is of course often used
along with the -A* switches. Both the aspect orbs and midpoints are displayed
to the nearest minute, and on the main diagonal (or edges if a relationship
aspect grid) is displayed the sign and degree of the planet in question in
addition to the planet name itself.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-g0:</span> Like -g but flag aspect configurations
(e.g. Yods) too.</p>

<p class=B>Search through the aspect grid for major aspect configurations,
including Grand Trines, T-Squares, Grand Crosses, Yods, Cradles, Mystic
Rectangles, and Stelliums, with the -g0 option. In a Stellium, three or four objects
must all be conjunct with each other. In a Cradle, four objects form three
sextiles producing a chain of sextiles half way around the zodiac. In a Mystic
Rectangle, there are two trines and two sextiles forming a rectangle. This option
will produce the same aspect grid that -g displays, but afterwards it will go
through the grid and list any of these aspect configurations and what objects
are forming them. Note that for Yods, the Inconjunct aspect must be
unrestricted in order to see them (e.g. include -A 6). Note that for Stelliums,
three and four planet conjunction Stelliums are listed separately, which means
the three redundant three planet Stelliums within each four planet Stellium
wont be shown.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-gm:</span> For comparison charts, show midpoints
instead of aspects.</p>

<p class=B>For relationship aspect grids, the -gm switch will display a
midpoint grid instead of an aspect grid between the planets in the two charts
e.g. -r0 chart1 chart2 -gm.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-ga:</span> Like -g but indicate applying/separating
instead of offset orbs.</p>

<p class=B>Ability to determine whether an aspect is applying or separating (is
about to happen or just happened) is included in the -g option. Normally the
aspect orbs are flagged as being '+' or '-' based on whether they are greater
or less than the exact amount (e.g. a 91 degree Square has a +1 degree orb
while a 89 degree one a -1 orb.) If one invokes the -g option as -ga instead,
an orb printed as 'a' will indicate an applying aspect while an orb with 's' a
separating one. (To estimate applying vs. separating, the program examines the
planetary positions and their relative velocities at the time in question.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-gp:</span> Like -g but generate parallel and
contraparallel aspects.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can do parallel and contraparallel aspects. Two planets are
parallel when they have the same declination with respect to the equator, and
are contraparallel when their declinations are the same amount but on opposite
sides of the equatorial plane. The -gp switch will turn on the aspect grid just
like the -g option, but will also set it so the grid contains parallel and
contraparallel instead of normal aspects. This feature works for the -g aspect
and relationship aspect grids, and the graphics versions of them. The graphic
glyph for the parallel aspect is two vertical parallel lines, while the glyph
for contraparallel are two sets of two lines crossing each other, like a
tic-tac-toe grid. In -gp affected charts, the parallel takes the place of
conjunction, and contraparallel the place of opposition.</p>

<p class=B>All aspect orb settings affecting conjunction and opposition will
affect the -gp aspects in the same way. (Note that the best orb for parallel
aspects is only a degree or so, hence the default conjunction orb will likely
be too high, and should be decreased with the -Ao switch for -gp grids.) The -A
and -RA aspect selection switches will also affect -gp, but all aspects beyond
the first two are ignored as only the parallel and the contraparallel aspects
are considered. Applying/separating indicators will be shown for parallel and
contraparallel aspects, and when the applying aspects setting is not active,
then the +/- sign for the orb will show whether the average of the two planets
positions is above or below 0 declination.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-a:</span> Display list of all aspects ordered by
influence.</p>

<p class=B>Aspects may be displayed in a nice ordered list, instead of only in
the -g aspect grid. Use the -a switch and get a list of every aspect from the
aspect grid printed out one per line. The two planets are printed, the aspect
they make, their orb, and then the power of the aspect used in ordering. This
chart also will flag notable aspects such as Moon phases (e.g. Full Moon) and
eclipses (if the -Yu switch setting is on). The order in which the aspects are
printed is based on the total power in the aspect, i.e. the influence of the
two planets in question, the aspect in question, and the orb. The same info and
data from the -j influence charts (see later) are used here, so changing any
default influences there will affect this ordering. Any power number more than
10 should be a very significant aspect. An exact Sun Moon conjunction can
exceed 25. So, if you want to know, for example, if that exact Mars Jupiter
conjunction is more powerful than that wide Sun Moon sextile, try a -a chart
and find out what Astrologs opinion is.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-a0:</span> Like -a but display aspect summary too.</p>

<p class=B>This is just like the -a aspect list ordered by influence chart,
except that summary information will be displayed afterward. The sum of all the
aspect powers and their average is printed, the total number of aspects of each
type is printed, and the total number of aspects to each planet is printed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-aa:</span> Like -a but indicate applying/separating
instead of offset orbs.</p>

<p class=B>This is a shorthand way to bring up the -a or -a0 sorted aspect
chart, with the aspect orbs shown as applying or separating, instead of
positive or negative offsets to the exact aspect size. This is like how -ga
does the same thing with the -g aspect grid switch. (To get the functionality
of -aa without this, one can use the -ga switch itself along with -a, and then
include -g by itself again, e.g. -a -ga -g, to toggle the aspect grid back
off but leave the applying vs. separating setting on!)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-ap:</span> Like -a but do parallel and contraparallel
aspects.</p>

<p class=B>The -a aspect list can be made to list all parallel and
contraparallel aspects if invoked as -ap or -a0p, turning on the same flag as
the -gp switch above. When in effect, the parallel aspects setting will also
affect -D and -T transit influence charts, having them show their aspects in
parallel too. This setting will also add results to the -d transit to transit
times search, and the -t transit to natal times search, in which theyll also list
parallel aspects and when parallel transits happen (instead of only working
with standard aspects).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-a[jonOPACDm]:</span> Sort aspects by power, orb, orb
difference, 1st planet, 2nd planet, aspect, 1st position, 2nd position,
midpoint.</p>

<p class=B>The aspect list chart can sort the aspects it displays by several
different methods. This applies both to the single chart and relationship
comparison versions of the display. The sorting method set here will also
affect the transit influence charts (-D and -T switches). The -a switch can be
followed by nine different subswitch characters:</p>

<p class=B>-aj: Sort by power. High total power aspects appear earlier, and
lower power later. This is the default.<br>
-ao: Sort by orb. Narrow orbs appear earlier and wider orbs later. This only
considers the magnitude of the orb, and will intersperse applying and
separating orbs among each other.<br>
-an: Sort by orb difference. This considers the sign of the orb, and will
place all applying orbs or angles less than the aspect size before all
separating orbs or angles more than the aspect size.<br>
-aO: Sort by planet. More specifically sort by the first planet listed, and
within each planet sort by the second planet listed.<br>
-aP: Sort by second planet. More specifically sort by the second planet listed,
and within each planet sort by the first planet listed.<br>
-aA: Sort by aspect. Within each aspect, sort by planets as with the -aO
method.<br>
-aC: Sort by zodiac position of the first planet listed.<br>
-aD: Sort by zodiac position of the second planet listed.<br>
-am: Sort by midpoint of the two planets' zodiac positions.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-m:</span> Display all object midpoints in sorted
zodiac order.</p>

<p class=B>True midpoint charts are supported in addition to the midpoints that
can be seen in the -g aspect grid. Use the -m switch and get a list of all
midpoints printed out sorted in zodiac order. This will show both the actual
midpoint location, as well as the angular difference between the two objects
displayed to the nearest minute. So if you want to see, say, if any important
midpoint is close to your Sun, this is a much easier chart to use than
scrutinizing the midpoint/aspect grid.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-m0:</span> Like -m but display midpoint summary too.</p>

<p class=B>This is just like the -m midpoint list ordered by zodiac position
chart, except that summary information for it will be displayed afterward. The
average number of degrees spanned between each planet pair is printed, and the
total number of midpoints in each zodiac sign is printed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-ma:</span> Like -m but show aspects from midpoints to
planets as well.</p>

<p class=B>Aspects to midpoints are supported with the -ma switch. This feature
will do the same as the -m midpoint list chart, except in addition to listing
each midpoint, a sublist of each aspect in effect from a natal planet to the
position of that midpoint, will be shown after it. The orb of the aspect will
be printed too, where the orb will be shown as either wide or narrow, or
applying or separating, based on the value of the -ga or -aa applying aspects
setting.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Z:</span> Display planet locations with respect to
the local horizon.</p>

<p class=B>The text display switch -Z prints out where each object is on the
local horizon in terms of altitude and azimuth. For each object, the following
is displayed: Its altitude on the local horizon from +90 degrees (straight up)
to -90 degrees (straight down), and its azimuth from 0 to 360 degrees, where 0
= due east, 90 = north, 180 = west, 270 = south. To make visualizing the
azimuth easier, an azimuth vector with a N/S component and a W/E component is
displayed, e.g. (1.00s 0.33w) means that the object is mainly south, with its
true angle being formed by a vector component west thats 1/3 the strength of
the south component, i.e. the object is about 18 degrees west of south. This
along with the altitude should make it easy to physically point to where any
planet is at any moment, making it easy to locate planets in the night sky.
This data can also be used to see when planets rise and set. Also displayed are
altitude and azimuth differences between each object and the Sun and Moon,
first showing the number of degrees that the Sun/Moon is ahead (or farther
east in the zodiac) of the object in question, and then the number of degrees that
the Sun/Moon is above the object in question. This feature can be used to
roughly predict eclipses: Both the Sun and Moon span about 0.5 degrees in the
sky, therefore if both the azimuth and altitude differences are &lt; 0.5 (or
1.0 if the difference is between the Sun and Moon themselves) then the object
in question is probably being occulted somewhat by the Sun/Moon. Note that
there are three types of planetary position displays: Right ascension and
declination showing the objects position with respect to the stars, longitude
and latitude showing where on the Earth the object is straight up (as in the
astro-graph zenith locations), and finally azimuth and altitude showing the
positions of the object relative to the local horizon.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Z0:</span> Like -Z but express coordinates relative
to polar center.</p>

<p class=B>This will do a text chart just like the -Z local horizon switch
above except that it will print the location of each planet in prime vertical
coordinates, instead of altitude and azimuth. Prime vertical coordinates are
measured with its azimuth around the 360 degree circle, with 0 degrees due
east on the local horizon, going down with 90 degrees straight down, 180
degrees due west and so on; declination altitudes are measured with positive
values toward the north and negative toward the south.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Zd:</span> Search day for object local rising and
setting times.</p>

<p class=B>One can display the rising and setting times of the Sun, Moon, and
planets with this feature. Specifically, when this switch is included, the
program will, for the entire day specified in the chart information, display
whenever a planet rises (specifically conjuncts the local horizon while in the
eastern hemisphere), sets (conjuncts horizon in west), reaches its zenith point
(or specifically conjuncts the meridian while in the southern hemisphere, i.e.
is due south from the observer), and reaches its nadir point (conjuncts
meridian in north). Note that some stars may be high or low enough that they
will never rise or set, but instead will just zenith or nadir twice in a
day as they spin around the pole.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Zd[m,y,Y] [&lt;years&gt;]:</span> Like -Zd but for
entire month, year, or years.</p>

<p class=B>The -Zd switch which supports scanning an entire month, year, or
range of years. The -Zdm switch will scan the entire month, the -Zdy switch
will scan the whole year, and the -ZdY &lt;years&gt; switch will scan the
number of years specified starting with the current year.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-S:</span> Display x,y,z coordinate positions of
planets in space.</p>

<p class=B>Solar system space based charts are available with the -S switch,
which give the astronomical positions of each planet in terms of x, y, and z
coordinates. Although not directly useful astrologically, it does give one a
good view of how the planets actually were positioned at the time in question.
For example, normal astrology doesn't make the distinction between the four
different forms of say, a Mercury Venus Conjunction, i.e. they can either be
Conjunct on the near side of the Sun, Conjunct on the far side of the Sun, or
one can be on one side and the other on the other side. When the chart is
actually displayed, for each body the following information is printed: The azimuth
or relative angle of the planet with respect to the central body, i.e. its
zodiac position in the current display format. This is followed by the x, y,
and z coordinate positions of the object, in astronomical units from the
central body. The x-axis increases in the direction of 0 degrees Aries
(tropical zodiac), the y-axis increases in the direction of 0 degrees Cancer,
and the z-axis is with respect to the Earths orbit (meaning that the Sun and
Earth always have a z-axis value of 0.0). Finally the overall length from the
central body in Astronomical Units (AU) is printed, which is just the diagonal
as indicated by the x, y, z vectors. (The Earth and Sun are of course always
about 1.0 AU from each other.) For star objects, the Length column will
measure light years instead of AU. (Note that 1 light year is about 63000 AU,
so the stars are actually more distant by this factor.) The -e everything
option will include this chart in its listing of all the chart displays.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-l:</span> Display Gauquelin sectors for each planet
in chart.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog supports Gauquelin sector charts. These are based on the
work of Michael Gauquelin, with a sector chart basically a type of wheel chart
where the planets are placed in their appropriate Gauquelin sector instead of
zodiac sign at a given time. Sectors are numbered from 1 to 36, and indicate
proportions of time between rising and setting. Sectors 1 through 18 are above
the horizon, and 19 through 36 are below. When a planet rises it goes from
sector 36 to 1, when 1/18th of the time until the moment it sets has passed it
enters sector 2, and so on. A sector chart can be thought of as somewhat
related to a standard wheel chart, except that its time based instead of location
based. In interpretation, certain sectors are known to be powerful. These
sectors are called plus zones and are the sectors immediately before and a bit
after the four angles. For a more detailed account on interpretation, see books
such as Gauquelins Cosmic Influences on Human Behavior. To bring up a sector
chart, use the -l command switch.</p>

<p class=B>The text mode version of this chart is similar to the standard -v
listing. The chart info time and place will be displayed, after which, for each
planet, the sector its in will be displayed, with a + indicating a plus
zone, and a - indicating such is not the case (where with colored text active
plus zones will be in red and minus dark green). Then as in the standard listing,
the planets house, zodiac location, retrogradation status, equatorial
latitude, and velocity will be printed. Finally will be displayed two
alternative sector locations assuming systems where sectors go from 1 to 18,
and from 1 to 12 (where for example the beginning of sector 36 will map to
sector location 18.5, and 12.75, respectively). After this, summary information
will be displayed. The number and percentage of planets that fall in plus zones
(as well as the number and percentage of plus zones period) will be printed,
and for each of the 36 sectors, the number of planets that fall in it and
whether its a plus zone will be indicated.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-l0:</span> Like -l but approximate sectors using
Placidus cusps.</p>

<p class=B>Calculating correct Gauquelin sector positions is based on rising
and setting times, which require searches, hence computing the chart takes
longer than regular wheels. Its like the -Zd rising and setting list, in which
increasing the -d searching divisions value increases the accuracy and
calculation time here too. To cut calculation time down to that of ordinary
charts, one may do a reasonable approximation of sector positions based on how
far each planet has moves through a corresponding house (specifically house
cusps divided using Placidus). To compute charts in this faster manner, invoke
the -l switch as -l0. Note that since these sector positions are approximate,
planets may appear to move in this chart when compared to the accurate -l
chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-j:</span> Display astrological influences of each
object in chart.</p>

<p class=B>Another chart type is available - interpretation of influences. This
is part of the general interpretation ability of the program. What this chart
does is calculate the relative power of each planets placement, giving a
general idea of dominants or the prominent areas of a chart. In the chart, each
planet is given a point value, with larger numbers indicating more strength.
Each planets strength is divided between two fields: the positioning in and of
itself, and the power of the aspects it makes with the other planets. In
addition to each field, the total of these two areas is printed, as well as the
relative percentage of the planet in question with respect to all the planets
combined. Each planet gets a ranking for its positioning, aspects, and total power
as well, with the strongest getting #1, the next strongest #2, etc. The -e
option will include this chart along with all the others as well in its listing
of all the chart displays.</p>

<p class=B>To determine the strength of the positioning of a planet, various
things are taken into account:<br>
1) The power of a planet in and of itself, e.g. the Sun and Moon are more
powerful than the other planets.<br>
2) The house placement of a planet, e.g. a planet in the 1st house is more
powerful than one in the 2nd.<br>
3) Whether a planet is in the sign it rules or is exalted in, e.g. Jupiter in
Sagittarius results in more power to Jupiter. Esoteric and Hierarchical rulers
will be considered too, if such rulerships are unrestricted (via the -YR7
switch).<br>
4) Whether a planet is in the house corresponding to the sign it rules or is
exalted in, e.g. Jupiter in the 9th house.<br>
5) Planets get more power if the signs they rule are occupied, e.g. a bunch of things
in Aquarius gives more power to Uranus.<br>
6) Planets get more power if the houses they rule are occupied, e.g. a bunch of
things in the 11th house gives power to Uranus.<br>
7) Finally, planets get power according to what house cusps fall in the signs
they rule, e.g. the ruler of the Ascendant (and to less extent the Midheaven)
gets lots of influence.</p>

<p class=B>Determining the strength of a planets aspects is much easier, and
is basically composed of the sum of the strength of each aspect the planet
makes. Taken into account are:<br>
1) The influence of the planet being aspected to, e.g. Sun conjunct Jupiter
gives more influence to Jupiter than Mercury conjunct Jupiter would. The planets
placement as described above plays a role, too, e.g. Venus opposition Mars in
Aries gives more influence to Venus that it would be if Mars were in Taurus.<br>
2) The influence of the aspect itself, e.g. Oppositions are more powerful then
Sextiles.<br>
3) Finally the orb of the aspect, i.e. exact aspects are more powerful than
wide ones. The influence of the orb varies linearly from max power at exact to
zero power at the limit of the orb. Sorry Maggie M. and Mark K. - no complex
aspect wave functions, at least for this version. ;)</p>

<p class=B>Special thanks goes to Mark K. who initially presented this idea of
interpreting overall influences to me. I basically just started with his ideas,
polished them a bit, and put it into the program. Interestingly, while
programming this feature I had a dream about him, in which he elaborated upon
some of the ideas and even gave me suggestions for some of the planets default
power values. Perhaps this was an astral plane visitation? ;) While on the
subject, I've had a couple of other Astrolog dreams; I had a neat one while
working on the -h switch heliocentric feature about a far distant future
version of Astrolog that could actually teleport one to the planets which they
cast charts centered upon. :)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-j0:</span> Like -j but include influences of each
zodiac sign as well.</p>

<p class=B>The -j planet influences in a chart feature can be expanded to
include signs as well. Invoke it as -j0 instead of just -j, and in addition to
getting the influence of each planet in a chart, one will get the influence of
each sign in the chart as well. To determine sign influence, we use the planet
powers already determined; a sign gets influence if:<br>
(1) There is a planet in it.<br>
(2) There is a planet in the house it corresponds to.<br>
(3) If any planet that rules or co-rules it is in the chart.</p>

<p class=B>For example, with my 11th house Venus in Sagittarius, for me: (1)
Sagittarius gets more power because Venus is in it, (2) Aquarius gets more
power because Venus is in the 11th, and (3) Libra and Taurus get power because
Venus itself rules these signs. The exact power given is based on the total
influence of Venus already determined. Any sign that has over about 175 points
or 20% of the total is a really powerful and a fundamental part of the psyche.
We also sum up the influences of all the signs (which will logically total up
to the sum of all the planets), and display the influence of each element as
well, and each mode as well, all this being perhaps a more accurate version of
the element table in the -v chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-7:</span> Display Esoteric Astrology and Ray summary
for chart.</p>

<p class=B>A chart for Esoteric Astrology is available. It will list planets,
showing the planets Ray, the planets position and the Ray(s) of its zodiac
sign, and rulership information about the planets zodiac position and house
position. That includes whether the planet exoterically rules or is debilitated
in the sign (indicated with R or d characters), whether the planet
esoterically rules or is debilitated in the sign (S or s characters),
whether the planet Hierarchically rules or is debilitated in the sign (H or h
characters), whether the planet exalts or falls in the sign (X or f characters),
and finally whether the planet Ray rules or is Ray debilitated in the sign i.e.
whether the planets Ray is the same as one of its signs Rays (Y or z characters).
For a double Ray rulership, or when a planets Ray is the same as both the
signs and houses Ray, the Y will be Y2 instead. Finally the power of each
planet is listed, based on its inherent strength, positioning, and aspects,
which is computed in the same way as in the -j switch influence chart.</p>

<p class=B>The esoteric chart also lists the seven Rays, showing the count of
planetary sign positionings that are associated with that Ray, the total power
of those planets, and the rank of each Rays total power and the percentage
covered by that Ray. This can be used to see which Rays are most influential in
a chart. The same counts and powers are repeated, however this time a sign
associated with multiple Rays only contributes proportional slices of power. By
default, each Ray is associated with three signs, so for balanced Ray coverage
that gives each Ray an equal potential for power, the first count values are
preferred. However, some signs are associated with one Ray, while others are
with two or three, which means certain signs have triple potential to
contribute power, so for balanced planet coverage that gives each sign an equal
potential for power, the second slice values are preferred. For more about Esoteric
Astrology in Astrolog, see: <a

<p class=A><span class=S>-L [&lt;step&gt;]:</span> Display astro-graph
locations of planetary angles.</p>

<p class=B>The '-L' option will take the standard chart information and
generate the astrocartography positions of the planets. In other words, this
does the exact same thing that Jim Lewis Astro*Carto*Graphy maps do. It will
display the longitude of where on the Earth at the time in question each object
was on the midheaven and on the nadir, and the latitude of where the planets
actually appeared at zenith. Also, for latitude increments of 5 degrees, the
longitude of where the objects appeared on the ascendant and descendant is
displayed. For text screens, one can pass an optional parameter to this -L (or
-L0) option to change the default latitude step rate at which the Ascendant and
Descendant lines are computed. Again, this value is by default 5 degrees, although
one can may increase or decrease it to any integer.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-L0 [..]:</span> Like -L but display list of latitude
crossings too.</p>

<p class=B>Determination of latitude crossing points is available in the
astro-graph feature. The -L0 option will do the same thing as -L, except that
after displaying the longitude and latitude locations of the Asc/Desc/MC/IC
lines, it will then search among the lines and display (in order from farthest
North to farthest South) the latitude of any points where lines cross each
other. This includes the curvy Asc/Desc lines crossing the straight MC/IC lines
as well as cases where different Asc/Desc lines cross themselves. Astrolog will
also display the longitude of the crossing (useful for Asc/Desc crossings) in
addition to the latitude. Display is from +90 to -90 degrees latitude, or more
specifically stepping will include every degree before 90, so the default step
rate of 5 will reach to 85 degrees. Note there is presently a small and rare
minor omission in the code, where if a crossing is within a couple of degrees
of 180 deg W/E, it may not be displayed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-K:</span> Display a calendar for given month.</p>

<p class=B>The -K switch generates a simple calendar for the month specified in
the current chart. This is a standard type of chart generatable from a date so
the -e everything switch includes this -K chart along with all the others. Note
that this is technically a non-astrological chart, but generic calendars are
useful and easy to generate with all of Astrologs date determination features,
so the option to create them using Astrolog is included. The calendars are
compact, with one text row per week. The day specified in the current chart
will be highlighted in green assuming -k Ansi color is active, e.g. -n -K will
generate a chart for this month, with the number of todays date highlighted.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Ky:</span> Like -K but display a calendar for the
entire year.</p>

<p class=B>The -Ky switch is just like -K except that it will generate a
calendar for the whole year. All twelve months will be displayed on the screen,
each just like the individual monthly calendars above but printed in four rows
of three months each.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-d [&lt;step&gt;]:</span> Print all aspects and
changes occurring in a day.</p>

<p class=B>The -d option will take the standard chart information, and for the
day in question, display the exact times of all aspects that occur. This is similar
to the aspects-per-day as displayed in Jim Maynards Celestial Guide books.
(Displayed in local time as defined by the default zone, with accuracy based on
the searching divisions setting, described below.) This will tell any time when
two planets make aspects with each other, a planet changes its sign, or a
planet goes retrograde or direct. Both the -d (and -t listed later) options
will display the signs that any planets aspecting each other are in, in
addition to the aspect itself (e.g. instead of just Jupiter Trine Uranus, we
have Jupiter (Vir) Tri (Cap) Uranus. If a particular object is going
retrograde, then its sign will be displayed in brackets instead of parentheses,
and if an object is about to or has just gone retrograde or direct, then its
sign will be in &lt;&gt;s. If the Print Nearest Second setting is on (-b0
switch) then these positions will be printed to the nearest arc-minute.</p>

<p class=B>This chart will include aspects involving house cusp objects if the
Graphs Include All Planets setting is on (-B0/V0 switches). Normally cusp
objects like the Ascendant are always excluded from this chart (even if
unrestricted) to avoid too many aspects being displayed. This is an option if
you want to see when planets conjunct house cusps, which also means when during
the day they move between houses.</p>

<p class=B>This display will also indicate when the Moon goes void of course.
The Moon is void of course (v/c) between the time of the last aspect it makes
and when it enters the next sign. The last aspect the Moon makes will be marked
as the Moon going void of course, along with how long the Moon is void of
course before it enters the next sign. There are different ways to measure the
last aspect the Moon makes, and for flexibility Astrolog simply bases it on
which aspects and planets are unrestricted. Note the Moon going void of course
wont be detected if a Moon aspect event isnt displayed some time before a
Moon sign change event in the list. That means the Moon and sign changes need
to be unrestricted, in order for void of course periods to be seen.</p>

<p class=B>This switch accepts an optional accuracy parameter, a value which
tells how many searching divisions or segments we should divide each day or period,
when doing these aspect searches. More segments is slower but can be more
accurate by a few minutes. This command line change of the step rate can also
be done for other charts such as the -t transit search by using the switch
toggle feature to turn -d off but still leave the divisions value set, e.g. -d
100 -d -t will set the value to 100 but not actually display the -d chart. Or
better yet just use the colon switch prefix to not affect the -d setting at
all, e.g. :d 100 -t. In general, I suggest this value be set to around 48,
but it is easy to experiment to see what is best for the speed of your
computer. One may increase this value up to 2880 (if they don't mind the wait)
which will mean a chart every 30 seconds for -d aspect in day charts and one
every 15 minutes for -t transit search charts.</p>

<p class=B>Note its possible for transit event searches to have too many
events per time period. This condition requires having many objects
unrestricted combined with a short searching divisions setting. If such a
scenario does happen then an appropriate warning message will be displayed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-dm:</span> Like -d but print all aspects for the
entire month.</p>

<p class=B>The -d option can search the entire month for aspects between
planets if one so desires. Specifying it as -dm instead of just -d will go
through the entire month instead of just the current day. (Combining this one
with -R allows searching for important aspects, sign changes, etc.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-dy:</span> Like -d but print all aspects for the
entire year.</p>

<p class=B>The -d option can search the entire given year for events as well,
if its specified as -dy instead of just -d or -dm. Note that transit to
transit event searches over an entire year or years may take longer to run. Because
of this, these searches will divide the searching divisions setting by 10. That
means a searching divisions parameter of 100 used for a yearly search will be
equivalent to a searching divisions parameter of 10 used for a monthly search.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-dY &lt;years&gt;:</span> Like -d but search within a
number of years.</p>

<p class=B>The -d search may also do a range of years all at once. Invoke the
switch as -dY, and give a parameter indicating the number of years to span, and
it will be done, starting with the year in the current chart. For example, to
display the times of all New and Full moons for the next two years (2020
through 2021), do astrolog -n -dY 2 -R0 sun moo -A opp. (This is similar to
the -EY and -tY features which also allow doing a range of years in addition to
a single year or month.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-dp &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt;:</span> Print aspects
within progressed chart.</p>

<p class=B>Another progression feature allows determining aspect times of
progressed planets among themselves. The -dp &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; switch
will, like the -d option, display times of aspects and sign changes, for the
time around the chart in question, except that they will be progressed
throughout the month specified. Progressed planets move very slowly (year for
a day) so therefore there will usually be, if any, only a couple of aspects in
a given month. Also, since they move so slow, the accuracy is cut down, so the
dates given are probably only accurate about to the nearest day, in spite of
the times given to the minute. Note that Astrolog can scan for aspects of:
transiting planets among themselves (-d switch), transiting planets to natal
planets (-T switch), progressed planets to natal planets (-Tp), and progressed
planets among themselves (-dp). The only thing Astrolog can't directly do is do
progressed planets to transiting planets, although that may change in a future
version. :)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-dpy &lt;year&gt;:</span> Like -dp but search for
aspects within entire year.</p>

<p class=B>Since progressed planets move so slow and only a few aspects in a
progressed chart will appear each month, one might want to instead scan the
whole year. To do this, use the -dpy switch, which takes only one parameter for
the year. This switch is consistent in format to how with the -T and -E
switches one specifies an entire year.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-dpY &lt;year&gt; &lt;years&gt;:</span> Like -dp but
search within number of years.</p>

<p class=B>Related to above, the -dp option may also be done for a range of
years. Invoke the switch as -dpY, and pass in not only the year to search
within as with -dpy, but the number of years to scan from then. For example, do
display the times of all aspects within your progressed chart for the next
decade, do astrolog -i yourchartfile -dpY 2020 10.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-dp[y]n:</span> Search for progressed aspects in current
month/year.</p>

<p class=B>The -dp progression event search option can be invoked as -dpn to
search the current month, or -dpyn to search the entire current year. For
example, if I want to search for the exact times of all aspects in my natal
chart, progressed to any time this month, I simply do -i mychartfile -dpn.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-D:</span> Like -d but display aspects by influence
instead of time.</p>

<p class=B>This switch will display a chart listing all aspects in effect
within the chart in question, in order by influence based on their power when transiting.
This chart focuses upon and gives precedence to aspects of outer planets with
each other, as opposed to common inner planet configurations. For example, at
the time in early January 1994 the most influential aspects in effect were the
Uranus Neptune conjunction and the Saturn Pluto square. This chart is very much
like the format of the -a aspect list chart, except that we are using the
transit as opposed to natal influences of the planets. The -a chart is most
appropriate for a persons natal chart, in that the inner planets are focused
upon, such as a Sun Moon square will be near the top of the list. This -D chart
is more appropriate for times as opposed to people, since it focuses upon rare
outer planet configurations. This chart is also very similar to the -T transit
influence chart, in that it shows the aspect, applying or separating orb, and
power of the event with its present orb, except that this does influences of
transiting planets among themselves as opposed to aspects to a natal chart. If
you want to see what major events are coming up, and don't want things such as
Uranus Neptune conjunctions to sneak by, use this chart and watch the
configuration gradually rise to the top of the list as its orb narrows over
time. This chart may be combined with others and is included in the -e
everything switch.</p>

<p class=B>Like the -a aspect list, this chart will also print an aspect
summary afterward, listing the total and average power of the aspects, along
with the count of each aspect and the count of aspects to each planet. Like the
-a chart summary, this summary is on by default can be removed by turning off
the -a0 switch setting.</p>

<p class=N><span class=S>-B:</span> Like -d but graph all aspects occurring in
a day.<br>
<span class=S>-B[m,y,Y]:</span> Like -B but for entire month, year, or five
years.<br>
<span class=S>-B0:</span> Like -B but don't restrict fast moving objects from
graph.<br>
<span class=S>-V [..]:</span> Like -t but graph all transits occurring during
period.<br>
<span class=S>-V[d,y,Y] [[&lt;day&gt;] &lt;month&gt;] &lt;year&gt;:</span> Like
-V for day, year, or 5 years.<br>
<span class=S>-V[..]0:</span> Like -V but don't restrict fast moving objects
from graph.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog has a graphical transit chart, which consists of a table of
transit aspects, each aspect of which has its strength mapped over a period of
time. The result makes it easy to see when an aspect enters orb, is exact, and
leaves orb. These graphs also allow seeing cases when an aspect comes close to
but never becomes exact, which is a situation missed by charts that only
display times when aspects are exact. The transit graph comes in two forms:
transit to transit, and transit to natal. Both forms can be displayed to show
aspects within a single day, a single month, a single year, or a range of five
years. Counting text mode and graphics mode versions of these charts, there are
2x4x2 = 16 different transit graph chart types total! The transit to transit graph
is accessed via the -B command switch, which is identical in syntax to the
existing -d transit to transit times search, including all subswitches. The
transit to natal graph is accessed via the -V command switch, which is nearly identical
in syntax to the existing -t transit to natal times search, including all
subswitches. (One difference is that -B defaults to covering one day unless the
appropriate subswitch is specified, while -V defaults to covering one month.)</p>

<p class=B>The total number of different aspects that are active within the
period may be high, especially when considering fast moving objects like the
Moon and especially house cusps. Note that for graphic charts, if there are too
many transits to fit within the screen height, then later aspects will be
skipped (however in the Windows version the vertical scrollbar can be used to
scroll down the list of aspects). By default transit graphs dont include
aspects involving certain fast moving bodies (which means when the transiting
body is fast moving in the case of -V). Graphs involving a single day will skip
house cusp objects, graphs involving a month will skip the Moon as well, and
graphs involving year(s) will skip the Sun through Mars as well. If the -B and
-V switches are invoked as -B0 and -V0, then this automatic restriction wont
happen.</p>

<p class=B>In text mode transit graphs, each aspect has its own row, and each
character within a row represents a time period. If the aspect is within orb at
that time, then a digit from 0-9 is placed there, in which 0 means the orb is
0-10% exact on up to 9 which means the orb is 90-100% exact. Peaks in
influence (which usually but not always indicate when the aspect is exact or
100% within orb) are colored white to make them stand out better. Every row
will have at least one high point marked, even if its on one of the edges
where an orb is increasing at the boundary. In addition, the column
corresponding to the time of the chart (or to the transiting time in the case
of the transit to natal graph) will be marked with vertical bar characters.
Transit graphs also come in a graphics version (unlike the existing transit
time and transit influence charts which only have text versions). In the
graphics mode transit graphs, each aspect has its own row, in which each row is
a mini-graph plotting the aspects strength over time. Peaks and high points
will be marked in white, and for the transit to transit case, the column
corresponding to the time of the chart will be marked in dark green (unless the
-Xi switch modify display setting is active). In the Windows version, whether
the specific time is marked with a vertical line can be toggled with the
Graphics / Modify Chart command.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-E:</span> Display planetary ephemeris for given
month.</p>

<p class=B>The -E option will generate an ephemeris of the planet positions
each day for the month indicated in the given chart, as taken from the standard
interface. This is useful if you just want to see an overview of whats
happening some month in the sky. A dot after a planet location in the list
indicates the planet was retrograde at the time that day. For example, to see
the ephemeris for someones birth month, one can do the convenient -i
chartfile -E, or to see the ephemeris for this month, do -n -E (see -i and
-n options later). The -E text ephemeris switch may be combined with the -gp or
-ap parallel aspects feature to generate an ephemeris of ecliptic latitudes (or
equatorial declinations if the -sr flag is in effect) instead of the normal
zodiac longitudes.</p>

<p class=B>Note: The ephemeris listings obtain the time (and time zone) to cast
each days chart for (e.g. noon, midnight) from the chart information given it,
instead of always defaulting to something like midnight in the default time
zone. This is a bit more flexible since one may want to specify a noon or
6:00am or whatever ephemeris which wouldn't be possible otherwise. The -qm
&lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; switch (see later) always uses midnight for the time
and the default for the time zone, so when using this switch with -E, the
results will be a midnight ephemeris in this default zone. However, something
like -i yourchart -E to do an ephemeris for your birth month will display the
positions each day at your birthtime instead of at midnight.</p>

<p class=B>Note: This chart will include house cusp and other fast moving
objects that move around the zodiac in a single day, if such objects are
unrestricted. In such cases, its important to remember that object positions
in the ephemeris are only plotted once per day, so when an object such as the
Ascendant changes only a degree or so between one day and the next, within the
day the object did move around the entire zodiac.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Ey:</span> Display planetary ephemeris for the entire
year.</p>

<p class=B>To display an ephemeris for all twelve months in an entire year,
invoke the -E switch as -Ey. For example, to get an ephemeris for all of last
year, one can do -qy 2018 -Ey (see -qy and -qm options below).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-EY &lt;years&gt;:</span> Display planetary ephemeris
for a number of years.</p>

<p class=B>The -E ephemeris list feature may also do an ephemeris for a range
of years all at once. Invoke the switch as -EY, and pass a parameter indicating
the number of years to span with the ephemeris, and it will be done, starting
with the year in the current chart. For example, to do an ephemeris for all last
century from 1900 through 1999, do astrolog -qy 1900 -EY 100.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-E[]0 &lt;step&gt;:</span> Display ephemeris times for
days, months, or years.</p>

<p class=B>The text mode ephemeris can specify the step rate for ephemeris
output. The -E0 switch is like -E, except it takes an extra parameter
specifying the step rate factor of how often to display times. By default the
ephemeris chart displays times once per day, however it can also be a given
number of days, months, or years. The extra parameter should have the prefix
m for a step rate in months, y for a step rate in years, and d (or
nothing) for a step rate in days. For example, -E0 d2 will display positions
every other day, -Ey0 m3 will display positions once every three months, and
-EY0 1000 y10 will display positions once every ten years. Slower ephemeris
step rates are useful when displaying very slow moving objects, such as fixed
stars in the tropical zodiac or planetary nodes.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-e:</span> Print all charts together
(-v-w-g-a-m-Z-S-l-j-7-L-K-Zd-d-D-B-E).</p>

<p class=B>There are 17 main different formats of chart display available: The
standard listing of planet positions which you get without any switches or with
the -v option, the house wheel you get with -w, the aspect/midpoint grid you
get with -g, and the charts generated with the -a, -m, -Z, -S, -l, -j, -7, -L, -K,
-Zd, -d, -D, -B, and -E switches. The -e everything option will display the
chart in all 17 of these formats for about 1400 lines and 90K bytes of text! One
can even include the -t, -T and/or -V transit options below and include a few
more chart formats in the list (however transits require a time parameter to do
transits for, so they aren't really a single chart display and hence aren't
included in -e by default). Note that when doing text mode charts, the program
will display chart information (such as date and time) above most of them,
however when displaying multiple different text charts at once, only the first
chart will contain a header.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-t &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt;:</span> Compute all
transits to natal planets in month.</p>

<p class=B>The '-t &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt;' option will scan the entire
month specified, and print out any transits that happen, in that month, to the
planet positions as listed in the current chart as taken from the standard
interface. There will be often be quite a few events, even though fast moving
objects like the Moon aren't looked at by default (unless specified in the
default parameter file or with the -RT switch), so you might want to use this
with the -R option to limit this to just certain planets. The times are
displayed in the local time zone, and are reasonable accurate, where accuracy
can be increased by upping the value in the -d searching divisions setting; try
doing it for your birth month and your own chart - all planets should conjunct
their natal positions at about the time of your birth. To determine transits to
natal house cusps other than the Asc and MC, i.e. when does a planet change
house in your natal chart, include the -C switch described elsewhere. See the
-RT option, as well as the -YC smart cusps default, described later, for
options which directly affect this feature.</p>

<p class=B>This transit search supports 3D house ingress, and can display when
planets change 3D houses, if the 3D houses setting is on (-c3 switch).
Restricting a house cusp object will prevent display of planets entering the
corresponding 3D house, and turning on the restrict sign change events in
searches setting (-YR0 switch) will prevent the display of all 3D house events.</p>

<p class=B>Note that even transiting house cusps (and other fast moving objects
like the Part of Fortune, Vertex, and East Point) may be included in these
transit to natal searches. (To activate transiting cusp objects use the -RT
switch.) This allows one to determine the time of events such as when the
Ascendant today conjuncts your natal Sun. Note that as the house cusps travel
through all 360 degrees of the zodiac during the day, a cusp will make a
transit roughly 30 times as often as even the fast moving Moon, the Moon itself
making transits 12 times as often as planets like the Sun. So realize you may
get a flood of information, and hence probably do want to restrict all planets
and aspects youre not interested in. Note also that to get accurate times for
transiting cusp events, you probably want a high value for the -d searching
divisions setting (I recommend at least 200) which means longer calculations.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-tp &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt;:</span> Compute
progressions to natal in month for chart.</p>

<p class=B>Determining dates of transits of progressed planets to natal planets
can be done with the -tp &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; option. This is just like
the -t option, except that the exact aspects of progressed planets (rather than
transiting planets) to the planets in the chart are displayed. Progressions
occur much less often than transits, and there will only be a few, if any, in a
given month, so one might to invoke this as -Tpy, as described below.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-tr &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt;:</span> Compute all
returns in month for chart.</p>

<p class=B>This switch is a quick and convenient way to compute solar, lunar,
and other returns. As a return is when a transiting object conjuncts its natal
position, returns are findable using the generic -t transit to natal search.
However to only display returns with it and not every transit, one has to
restrict aspects to just the conjunction, and restrict objects to just the one
youre interested in. (But even that will still show things in addition to
returns if more than one object is unrestricted, e.g. with just Sun and Moon
you'll still get Sun to Moon conjunctions and vice-versa.) The solution is this
return feature, which (without altering your aspect or object restrictions any)
works just like the -t switch, but displays only returns in the transit list,
i.e. conjunctions between a transiting planet and that same planet in the natal
chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-t[p]d: &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt;:</span>
Compute transits for a single day.</p>

<p class=B>To display transits for a single day, invoke the -t switch as -td
(-tpd for progressions), which takes three parameters for the month, day, and
year. For example, -i chartfile -td Jun 5 2020.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-t[p]y: &lt;year&gt;:</span> Compute
transits/progressions for entire year.</p>

<p class=B>To display transits for an entire year, invoke the -t switch as -ty
(-tpy for progressions), which only takes one parameter, the year. For example,
-i chartfile -ty 2020.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-t[p]Y: &lt;year&gt; &lt;years&gt;:</span> Compute
transits for a number of years.</p>

<p class=B>One may search an arbitrary number of years at once for transits. The
-tY &lt;year&gt; &lt;years&gt; switch is like the -ty &lt;year&gt; switch,
except that -tY takes an extra parameter for how many years to search. For
example, -tY 2015 10 will search the ten years from 2015 through 2024 for
whatever transits. With a negative value for the years to scan, it will start
that many years before the given year, e.g. -tY 1999 -10000 will scan the
previous 100 centuries for transits, starting with 8002 B.C.! Note that this
switch may also be invoked as -tYn &lt;years&gt;, in which case it will start
from the current year and be an equivalent shorthand to -tY 2020 &lt;years&gt;
for this year at least.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-t[py]n:</span> Compute transits to natal planets for
current time now.</p>

<p class=B>This feature is a quick shorthand way to generate transits for the
current month. For example, instead of astrolog -i chartfile -t 1 2020, one
can do astrolog -i chartfile -tn. To do transits for the entire current year,
invoke it as -tyn.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-T &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt;:</span>
Display transits ordered by influence.</p>

<p class=B>The -T switch is a transit influence chart. Given a date, it will
take the transiting planets on that date, and determine how they interact with
the generic natal chart specified with -i or however. The information will be
printed as a list of transits, sorted in order from most significant to least
significant. For each transit in effect, the transiting and natal planets (and
the signs they are in) are displayed, along with the aspect and the orb, and
whether the transit is applying and going to happen in the future, or just passed
exactness and the orb is separating. The computer computed power value of each
transit will be printed too, in which anything over 100 is a very major
transit. Any transit thats a return, i.e. a transiting planet conjuncting the
same one in the natal chart, will be flagged with a capital R at the end of
the line.</p>

<p class=B>The things which affect how Astrolog computes the influence of a
transit are: The power of the object thats doing the transit, e.g. transiting
Pluto conjunct your natal Ascendant is much more powerful than the transiting
Moon conjunct your Ascendant. The power of the object being transited affects
the power too (but not as much as the transiter) e.g. Jupiter transiting your
Sun is more powerful than Jupiter transiting an asteroid. Finally, the orb
plays a role as well, in that a transit that will be exact in a couple of days
from the given date passed to -y is more powerful than one won't be exact for
another month. Note that the power of a planet when transiting is different
than its influence in the natal chart: Although Sun conjunct Moon is more
powerful in a natal chart than Saturn conjunct Moon, when transiting, Saturn
transiting Moon is much more influential than Sun transiting Moon. Hence there
are two lists of object influence values in the astrolog.as file (described
later) that can be customized. Theres the generic list of standard influences
(which have items like Sun, Moon, and Ascendant most powerful), and a parallel
list of transit influences (which have the slower moving bodies the most
powerful).</p>

<p class=B>Related to the -tr switch above, the -T switch can be invoked as
-Tr, which is the same as the general transit influence chart, but will only
display aspects between a transiting planet and the same natal planet. (Note
unlike -tr it will include aspects other than the conjunction.)</p>

<p class=B>This switch is in compliment to the -t transit search list, and you
may find this one more useful. The -t chart prints the times when a transit is
exact, which is useful to know, but doesn't really help when you want to know
when a transit enters orb enough to be significant, and it won't flag a major
year long transit that will be exact next month, listing it among a bunch of
less significant aspects for the following month. With -T, you can see a major
transit first enter orb at the bottom of the list, and then slowly rise to the
top as it becomes more exact through the days. And you can answer the question
as to which is more influential: say an exact transit of Mars to a minor house
cusp, or a major transit of Saturn to an angle thats still a month away from
exactness.</p>

<p class=B>Also notice the resemblance between -T and the -r0 -a combination.
Both display aspects ordered by influence. In fact, -i chart -Tn will look
almost identical to -y chart -a, except that -T is designed and formatted for
doing transits to a particular chart. (Doing -T will always use applying vs.
separating orbs, generate powers using the transit influences, and allow the
transiting and natal planets to be restricted separately with -RT and -R.)
Astrolog allows transit charts to be done between transiting planets and natal
planets, as well as charts among transiting planets to themselves, both of
which can be expressed as searches for exact times, or displays of influences
of each aspect at a particular time, as summarized in the following organized
list:</p>

<p class=B>-t switch: Display exact times of transits to natal planets.<br>
-T switch: Display influences of transits to natal planets.<br>
-d switch: Display exact times of aspects among transiting planets.<br>
-D switch: Display influences of aspects among transiting planets.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Tt &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt;
&lt;time&gt;:</span> Like -T but specify time too.</p>

<p class=B>The -Tt switch is just like -T, except in addition to month/day/year
parameters for the transit influence chart date, it also takes a fourth
parameter for the time within the date.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-T[t]p &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt;:</span>
Print progressions instead of transits.</p>

<p class=B>The -T transit influence switch can also (like the -t transit
search) display all aspects between progressed planets and natal planets in
influence order, if its invoked as -Tp instead of just -T. This works like -T
in every way except that a switch combination like -i mychart -Tp 12 31 2020 will
display aspects between my natal planets, and those in my natal chart
progressed to the end of the year, and their influence and orbs at that time,
instead of between my natal planets and the actual positions of the planets at that
time.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-T[p]n:</span> Display transits ordered by influence
for current date.</p>

<p class=B>The -Tn switch is a shorthand way to pass the current date today and
time now to the -T switch. If you want to see what transits are most affecting
your natal chart presently, just do -i yourchart -Tn.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-P [&lt;parts&gt;]:</span> Display list of Arabic
parts and their positions.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog has the ability to display the positions of 177 Arabic
parts. The ARABIC compile time option in astrolog.h may be commented to leave
this feature out if you don't want it. Display a chart with the -P switch to
show each part and its position, one per line for the chart in question. The
listing contains five columns: First is the name of the part, which is usually
called in full The Part of &lt;name&gt;. Second is its position in the zodiac
(which will be shown to the nearest arc second when the -b0 setting is active).
Third is the house the location falls in.</p>

<p class=B>Fourth is the formula used to compute the part, given so one knows
what the program is doing and to aid in interpretation. The formula is
expressed in the form &lt;term1&gt; - &lt;term2&gt; + &lt;term3&gt;. Also
included is a flag indicating whether the formula should be flipped for night
births, i.e. charts where the Sun is below the horizon in houses 1 through 6.
For night charts where the flip status is Y, the real calculation done is
&lt;term1&gt; + &lt;term2&gt; - &lt;term3&gt;. Each &lt;term&gt; consists of an
object plus a modifier. The object is usually given as the abbreviation of
a planet, or it may be a number from 1 to 12 indicating that house cusp. The
object may also be For or Spi meaning its the position of the Part of
Fortune or Part of Spirit, or it may reference an actual degree in the zodiac.
The modifier indicates how to get the actual position of the term from the
object. Its usually blank meaning the term is just the position of the object.
It may be H, meaning the term is the location of the house the given object
is in; it may also be R, meaning the term is the location of the planet
ruling the house the given object is in; it may be D, meaning the term is the
location of the planet thats the dispositor of the given object, i.e. ruler of
its position; or it may be +, meaning the term is 10 degrees beyond the
position of the given object.</p>

<p class=B>The last column is the type of Arabic part. Most parts are normal
psychological indicators like the Part of Fortune, and don't have anything
listed here. Seven parts reference elements and weather and are used for charts
cast at the time of equinoxes, solstices, and New and Full moons, and are
indicated by Event. 21 parts reference crops and are parts used in the
commodities market for prognostication, and are indicated by Comm. Finally 16
parts are specially used for Horary questions and are indicated by Hora.</p>

<p class=B>The -P switch accepts an optional parameter to indicate how many of
the Arabic parts to show. When given, only the first 'n' parts will be
displayed. As the special part types are shown after all the standard ones,
this may be used to restrict parts you don't care about. For example, -P 161 will
leave off the horary parts, -P 140 will leave off the horary and crop parts,
and -P 133 will leave off the horary, crop, and event parts. Related to this,
standard -R object restrictions will affect the parts shown. If a planet is
restricted, than any parts referencing it in its formula will be left out.</p>

<p class=B>This chart has an option to, for each part, display a list of
aspects from unrestricted planets to it. This is similar to how the -m midpoint
list chart can display aspects to midpoints, and as a result the text midpoint
list includes aspects to midpoints chart setting (-ma switch) will affect the
Arabic parts chart too.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-P0 [&lt;parts&gt;]:</span> Like -P but display
formulas with terms reversed.</p>

<p class=B>If the -P switch is invoked as -P0 (or -Pz0, etc) the output will be
identical to before, except that the formula column will exchange the positions
of the second and third terms, i.e. instead of showing as &lt;term1&gt; -
&lt;term2&gt; + &lt;term3&gt;, -P0 will show &lt;term1&gt; + &lt;term3&gt; -
&lt;term2&gt;. This isn't too useful in itself, unless combined with -Pf below,
where -Pf and -Pf0 sort differently giving different terms priority. Heres how
to conceptualize formulas: if the planets were rotated through the zodiac so
that object2 is at the position of object1, then the new position of object3 is
the part. For example, with the Part of Fortune being Asc - Sun + Moo for
daytime charts, if you rotate your chart so that the Sun is on the Asc, then
the Moons position is the POF, Mercurys position is the Part of Commerce, its
formula being Asc - Sun + Mer, and so on. The default -Pf sorting allows one to
easily see, if one rotates this planet on the Asc, what parts indicate the
positions of the other planets. The -Pf0 ordering allows one to easily see,
where is the position of a particular planet, after all rotations where some
other planet is on the Asc.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-P[z,n,f]:</span> Order parts by position, name, or
formula.</p>

<p class=B>As with the fixed stars, the Arabic part listing may also be sorted
in various useful orders. Invoke the -P switch as -Pz and they will be
displayed in order of position, with parts in Aries first and Pisces last.
Invoke it as -Pn and the parts will be sorted by name, with the part of
Accomplishment first and Worldliness last. Finally, invoke it as -Pf and they
will be ordered by formula, where the ordering reflects the contents of each
term, with Ascendant and early planet terms first, and cusp and other special
ones last. Note that regardless of the ordering, passing a value to -P will
still leave off the same parts as in the standard display. Especially with -Pz
and -Pf, notice that several parts may have the same position. Some formulas
differ only in their night flip flag, meaning they will be the same for day
charts, while a few parts of different category types can even have the exact same
formula.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-N [&lt;rows&gt;]:</span> Lookup chart location as
city in atlas.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog has an atlas, allowing one to easily lookup the longitude
and latitude of cities. This switch will look up the current city (as set in
the second parameter to the -zi switch, or the Location field in the Chart
Info dialogs). By default up to the 22 best matches are displayed, although the
switch takes one optional parameter for how many rows to potentially display,
which may range up to 200.</p>

<p class=B>You can specify just a city name, or use a comma to combine with a
country/region name or its two letter abbreviation, to restrict search to just
that region. For USA and Canada, states and provinces may be specified instead
of or in addition to the country. City names will match substrings, which will
be ranked in an appropriate manner. For example, if you lookup the city Eden,
the exact match Eden, NC will be first, followed by the subword exact match
of Eden Prairie, MN, then the substring match at the beginning/end of a word
in Edenvale, Germany, and finally the substring in the middle of a word
Redencao, Brazil.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Nl [&lt;rows&gt;]:</span> Display nearest cities in
atlas to chart location.</p>

<p class=B>This switch will display the nearest cities to the current longitude
and latitude coordinates. By default the 22 nearest are displayed, although the
switch takes one optional parameter for how many rows to display, which may
range up to 200.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Nz [&lt;rows&gt;]:</span> Display all time changes in
time zone of chart city.</p>

<p class=B>This switch will display all time changes for the time zone area
corresponding to the active charts city (as set in the second parameter to the
-zi switch, or the Location field in the Chart Info dialogs). If that string
doesnt match anything in the atlas, then time changes in all time zones will
be output instead, for a complete output of Astrologs worldwide database. This
chart will display every time change to or from Daylight Time, as well as
occasions when the time zone offset itself for the location changes. This will
range from the first date when the location started using a standard time zone
(which will be no earlier than 1847 when GMT was introduced). The list will run
until 2025, or five years after the charts date (whichever is later, but never
later than 2080). Time changes will be printed one per line, listing the date
and local time at which the time changes, along with how the time zone offset
changes and how much the local clock time changes.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-I [&lt;columns&gt;]:</span> Print interpretation of
selected charts.</p>

<p class=B>The -I display an interpretation option is an expansive feature to
generate interpretations of many of Astrologs charts. Simply include the -I
switch to get an interpretation of any particular type of chart that the
program would display otherwise. If Astrolog doesn't support interpretations
for it, the normal chart will be shown instead.</p>

<p class=B>For example, A brief interpretation of the meaning of the
positioning of each planet in its sign and house is supported when the -I
switch is invoked with -v (or by itself since -v is the default). If one does
this, then instead of the standard -v listing of planet positions, the
positions will be listed with a brief interpretation of what they mean. I have
to say that this is a pretty limited version of interpretation, being nothing
more than a combining of phrases representing the planet, sign, and house in
question; nevertheless, people who aren't experts at interpreting charts might
find this to be of use (or at least amusing. :)</p>

<p class=B>Another common interpretation one would want is the ability to give
a brief interpretation of each aspect in the aspect grid. When the -I switch is
combined with -g, the standard -g aspect grid will be replaced with a list of
each aspect occurring and a brief listing of what it means. Again, this is
mainly just a lookup of the general meanings of each planet and the aspect in
question, but still might be found of interest by some. (Note: only the first
11 aspects, out to the Bi-Quintile, will be considered.)</p>

<p class=B>Synastry relationship charts may be interpreted too, with the -r -I
combination. Actually, they could be technically interpreted without any
special code, since the output of a synastry chart is a technical chart with
planet and house positions, but it would just be an interpretation of Person2s
planets in Person1s houses as if that were a natal chart. This interpretation
feature recognizes charts generated with -r as synastry charts and interprets
them appropriately. For each of Person2s planets, the interpretation of how
and where it affects Person1 is displayed.</p>

<p class=B>Eight more interpretations just as useful can be done: -r0 person1
person2 -g -I is a legal combination, and will display meanings of aspects
between planets in two charts in a relationship aspect grid. -i person -a -I is
legal, and will display the meanings of aspects in a chart; this is like -g -I,
but the aspect meanings are printed in sorted order based on how powerful
Astrolog thinks each aspect is, so this is probably more useful. -r0 person1
person2 -a -I is legal, and will display the meanings of aspects in a
relationship aspect list, like -r0 -g -I, but in the improved sorted order. -d
-I is legal, and will display the meanings of aspects among transiting planets
occurring during a day, as well as of sign and direction changes. -t -I is
legal, and will display the meanings of aspects from transiting planets to
natal ones. -T -I is also legal, and will display the transit interpretations
in sorted order by influence. Finally, -m -I is a legal combination, which
will do an interpretation of a midpoint chart, printing each midpoint in the
same order as without the -I, but with each midpoint as an interpretation
sentence instead. Relationship midpoint charts may be interpreted in the same
manner using the -r0 person1 person2 -m -I combination.</p>

<p class=B>In displaying interpretation text, the program will use the name or
title field of the chart (exactly as entered by the user or as passed to the
-zi switch) when referring to a person. If this field is empty, the program
will use the generic labels this person, person1, or person2 as
appropriate. Also in interpretation text, the Fortune object will be
displayed with its full name Part of Fortune, and similarly the asteroid
Pallas will be displayed with its full name Pallas Athena (unless one has used
the -YD switch to change the name of those objects).</p>

<p class=B>This interpretation toggle switch accepts an optional parameter to
specify the number of screen columns in which to format the interpretation
paragraphs, i.e. what column to break lines at when formatting and printing.
One may change this from the default of 80 to accommodate narrower or wider screens
or printers.</p>

<p class=Section2>Switches which affect how the chart parameters are obtained:</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-n:</span> Compute chart for this exact moment using
current time.</p>

<p class=B>For those with systems who can handle time calls (If your system
errors on trying to compile them, simply comment out the #define TIME line at
the beginning), the program supports displaying the chart for the time at the
current moment! In other words, invoke as astrolog -n and see where the planets
are right now. (This is fun - the house cusps change one minute about every
four seconds!) You will need to change the #defines for the default longitude
and latitude in astrolog.h, or else specify where you are explicitly by using
the -zl switch to change the default location. To figure out the time zone, the
program uses the default value in the astrolog.as file or as defined in the
DEFAULT_ZONE constant set at compile time.</p>

<p class=B>Note that the default time zone setting or passing values to -z,
won't affect the positions of the planets, which is expected since they are
where they are now no matter how time is expressed. The default zone is
merely used to determine what to express the local time to when displaying the
current time. It is important however to realize that the time zone setting on
your system can affect the actual raw time the program gets internally for now.
If the -n switch seems to always generate times an hour or more off to what you
have your time zone set to, its likely that your time zone environment
variable is uninitialized or set incorrectly. You will need to set the TZ environment
variable, setting it to a value such as xxxnyyy, where 'n' is the hours your
zone is before UTC/GMT, 'xxx' is a three character string indicating the
abbreviation of the zone (required, but doesn't need to be set to anything more
than 'xxx' if you prefer) and 'yyy' is the abbreviation for the zone when/if
ever in Daylight Time. For example, if running Astrolog on a PC in Eastern
Time, put the line set TZ=EST5EDT in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Another way to
correct your now charts if they always seem to be off by a certain number of
hours is to use the -Yz switch (described later).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-n[d,m,y]:</span> Compute chart for start of current
day, month, year.</p>

<p class=B>These switches are like the -n generate chart for current moment now
feature, except that they will respectively generate charts for the midnight on
the current day, midnight on the first of the current month, and midnight on
the first day of the current year.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-z [&lt;zone&gt;]:</span> Change the default time zone
(for -d-E-t-q options).</p>

<p class=B>The -z &lt;value&gt; option can be used to change the default time
zone to the value in question. For example, you can force the -E ephemeris and
-t transit lists to be displayed at midnight UTC/GMT time instead of the local
time with -z 0. If Daylight time is in effect, you should set the separate
Daylight time default below. Note that one can technically get by without
changing the Daylight setting, by subtracting one from the time zone itself,
e.g. for EST where the time zone is 5, you can do -z 4 or -z EDT during
Daylight time to properly display transits, aspects in day, and other lists in
the local DST zone.</p>

<p class=B>Normally the -z switch takes an argument which will then become the
default time zone. If one, however, invokes it by itself, it will subtract one
hour from whatever the default time zone presently is. This is useful since it
is equivalent to adjusting any times printed to Daylight time, i.e. it will add
one hour to any times displayed. Again, this is archaic as its better to just
use the -z0 switch below. Without the -z0 setting, when entering the birth time
for charts, one would have to subtract one hour if Daylight time were in
effect, or subtract one hour from the time zone which will do the same thing.
For example, over here on the West Coast, I have my default time zone compiled
to be 8&quot;; when Daylight time is in effect here, I can do -z 7 or just -z
to decrease the default time zone when I make say a -t transit list, which will
in effect add one hour to the local times displayed, or in effect Spring ahead
the clock for me. (For a better way of adjusting Astrolog for Daylight time
without having to specify -z all the time, recompile the program, or add one
hour to times in your head, use the defaults file described later to edit the
default time zone or the Daylight setting.) Remember that the -z (and -zl)
switches should be before any other switches they modify (such as -n) in order
for the new default to take effect.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-z0 [&lt;offset&gt;]:</span> Change the default Daylight
time setting.</p>

<p class=B>This switch sets the contents of the default Daylight time setting,
and sets the value in the current chart as well, taking one optional parameter.
When present the parameter will be used for the Daylight hour offset, which
will almost always be 0 or 1, but can technically be set to something else for
Daylight offsets that Spring ahead amounts other than one hour. When omitted,
the -z0 switch will toggle the Daylight setting on and off between 1 and 0. In
addition to 0 and 1, this switch also accepts n and y (for no and yes)
as parameters.</p>

<p class=B>The -z0 switch will also accept autodetect (which may be
abbreviated as auto or a), in order to compute whether Daylight time is on
or off at the current moment. This allows charts for now to automatically use
Daylight time when the computers internal clock is using it. For example, an
animation continually updating to the current moment will change to or from
Daylight Time at the second the annual switchovers take place. Without this
option one would have to manually change this switch in their default settings
file twice a year.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-zl &lt;long&gt; &lt;lat&gt;:</span> Change the
default longitude &amp; latitude.</p>

<p class=B>Similar to the -z switch, the -zl option can be used to change the
default compile time world coordinates used in certain options, such as the -n
cast chart for right now switch. Note that both the -zl default longitude and
latitude, and the -z default zone switches affect the time and location of the
current chart in memory in addition to the default setting. Confusion could
result otherwise if changing a default after chart info was already obtained,
e.g. -z -n would be different from -n -z, where the latter wouldn't change
the zone for the chart because it was seen after the -n was processed and the
old zone used. The correct thing will happen regardless of ordering. This means
you can easily do a relocated chart with this -zl switch, e.g. -i yourchart
-zl 122W19:59 47N36:35 will cast your chart relocated to Seattle.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-zv &lt;elev&gt;:</span> Change the default elevation
above sea level.</p>

<p class=B>The default elevation used in topocentric charts may be specified
with this switch. Elevation above sea level can be expressed in meters (with an
m suffix) or feet (ft suffix). Note that this is a global setting, so
affects all charts. To fully support topocentric astrology, the standard
interface for specifying time and location should also ask for elevation above
sea level (although that piece of information would of course be unnecessary
for standard non-topocentric charts). As an example, changing from sea level to
the top of Mt. Everest (29028 ft, or 8848 m) can change the topocentric position
of the Moon by up to four arc seconds.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-zj &lt;name&gt; &lt;place&gt;:</span> Change the
default name and place strings.</p>

<p class=B>The default name and location strings used for charts (most commonly
for now charts) may be specified with this switch.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-zt &lt;time&gt;:</span> Set only the time of current
chart.</p>

<p class=B>This simple switch will set the time and only the time of the
current chart in memory to the given value. For example, to cast a chart for
3:00pm today, do -n -zt 3:00pm. Without this one would have to cast a whole
new chart using the -q switch and respecify the month, day, and year. Note that
placement of this switch is important, as any other switch after it which also
sets a time will clobber the setting, e.g. -zt 3:00pm -i chartfile will be
the same as just -i chartfile because the file has its own time value.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-zd &lt;date&gt;:</span> Set only the day of current
chart.</p>

<p class=B>This is just like the -zt switch above except that it takes one
parameter for and sets the day of the current chart. For example, to see the
aspects taking place on the 15th of the current month, do -n -zd 15 -d, which
does the chart for the current month and year but the day scanned is the 15th
instead of the current day.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-zm &lt;month&gt;:</span> Set only the month of
current chart.</p>

<p class=B>This simple switch will set the month and only the month of the
current chart in memory to the given value. For example, to display an
ephemeris chart for July of this year, do -n -zm July -E.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-zy &lt;year&gt;:</span> Set only the year of current
chart.</p>

<p class=B>This is just like the -zm switch above expect it will set the year
and only the year of the current chart in memory to the given value. For
example, to display a chart for your birthday next year, do -i yourchart -zy 2020.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-zi &lt;name&gt; &lt;place&gt;:</span> Set name and
place strings of current chart.</p>

<p class=B>This switch sets on the command line the contents of the name and
city string fields of the current chart. Note that this switch is actually put
into present style chart info switch files generated with -o to reload the name
fields. You can convert an old style file created before version 4.20 to new
style and add in the name fields for it with: -i file -zi &quot;the name&quot; &quot;the
city&quot; -o file. (Note that you may also want to correct the time or time
zone if Daylight time was in effect though.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-zN &lt;city&gt;:</span> Lookup city in atlas and set zone,
Daylight, and location.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can do time zone detection (including whether Daylight
Saving Time is in effect or not) for any date/time at any location in the
world. This switch takes one parameter for a city name, and will automatically
look it up, and apply to the chart info the atlas coordinates, time zone, and
whether Daylight Time is in effect. This switch will look at or take as input
the current chart date and time fields, and as output will set the current and
default chart location, time zone, and Daylight Time fields. For example,
astrolog -qt Jun 5 2020 12:12pm -zN Seattle is a quick way to do a chart for
that city given the date and local time.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-q &lt;month&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;year&gt;
&lt;time&gt;:</span> Compute chart with defaults.</p>

<p class=B>The -q &lt;month&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;year&gt; &lt;time&gt; option
takes the four parameters and casts a chart for the time in question. The time
zone and location are taken from the default compiled values. This is just
another useful shorthand way to quickly make a chart. Note that the -qa option
which takes all seven chart parameters can be duplicated with -q along with the
-z &lt;zone&gt; and -l &lt;long&gt; &lt;lat&gt; options.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-qd &lt;month&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;year&gt;:</span>
Compute chart for noon on date.</p>

<p class=B>The -q &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt; option can be used to
cast a quick chart for 12 noon on a particular date, using the default
longitude and latitude, and time zone. One example where this is useful is with
the -d option, e.g. to see the times of exact aspects on a particular date,
like your next birthday, your finals, etc, without having to specify
unnecessary data. Note that this is just like the -q switch except that -q
requires a specific time on the day in question as well.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-qm &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt;:</span> Compute chart
for first of month. -qy &lt;year&gt;: Compute chart for first day of year.</p>

<p class=B>A quick chart cast for midnight on the first of a month can be
generated with the two parameter -qm &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; switch. A chart
cast for midnight on the first of January of a year can be generated with the
one parameter -qy &lt;year&gt; switch. Both of these use the default time zone
and location. These switches are most useful for charts that don't require all
the standard information. For example, to get an ephemeris for December 2020,
do astrolog -qm 12 2020 and avoid having to enter in a day, hour, or location
that wouldn't have any effect. These options are in similar to the -qd
&lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt; switch above that will do a chart for
noon on the given date, and the -q &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt;
&lt;time&gt; switch that takes a time as well.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-qa &lt;month&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;year&gt;
&lt;time&gt; &lt;zone&gt; &lt;long&gt; &lt;lat&gt;:</span> Compute chart
automatically given specified data.</p>

<p class=B>Normally one generates a new chart by entering the data coordinates
interactively. A fast typist familiar with the program might prefer to give all
the info at once, which can be done with this option. Simply list the seven
parameters above, in the exact format as they would be given to the program
were the user being prompted for them. (Note that its probably better to use
the -qb switch below because of its extra parameter; the -qa switch will
automatically assume Daylight time is off.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-qb &lt;month&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;year&gt;
&lt;time&gt; &lt;daylight&gt; &lt;zone&gt; &lt;long&gt; &lt;lat&gt;:</span>
Like -qa but takes additional parameter for Daylight offset.</p>

<p class=B>This switch is just like the -qa switch above except that it takes
one extra parameter for the Daylight Saving time flag. In order, the eight
parameters for -qb are Month, Day, Year, Time, Daylight offset, Time Zone,
Longitude, and Latitude. (Like -zi this switch is also put into chart info
files by -o.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-qj &lt;day&gt;:</span> Compute chart for time of
specified Julian day.</p>

<p class=B>This switch will automatically cast a chart for the given Julian
Day. Unlike the other -q switches which take standard months, days, and years,
this switch takes one parameter for the Julian Day (which may be fractional to
specify a time within the day in question). For example, another way to cast a
chart for Midnight, UTC, on New Years day of 2018 is with -qj 2458119.5.
(Julian Day 0 refers to Noon UTC, January 1, 4712 BC.)</p>

<p class=B>Note: If the Swiss Ephemeris and Placalc ephemeris files are turned
off, and only the ancient Matrix formulas are being used, then the program will
have to use an older version of the Julian day conversion routines which will
result in these -qj charts giving incorrect results for dates in the Julian Calendar,
i.e. before October 1582. This can be seen by casting a chart with -qj
specifying a day less than 2299161.5, in which case the Julian Day displayed
for the date of the chart cast will be ten days greater than what was passed to
it.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-i &lt;file&gt;:</span> Compute chart based on info in
file.</p>

<p class=B>See the -o option below.</p>

<p class=B>Note that there is a virtual file named set which can be passed
to the -i and -r switches. Instead of looking for an actual disk file, this
represents the last set of chart information dealt with, and is useful to
avoid having to manually enter information in certain cases. (Other virtual
files Astrolog can use are now which means the current time at the default
location, and tty which means prompt the user for the info.)</p>

<p class=C>This is best used within a -Q loop. For example, you first manually
enter the time for a chart and its displayed. Now, this time in the loop, you
want the same chart in an aspect grid, and don't want to have to enter the data
again or create a file to read from. Entering -i set will use this chart info
no matter how it was entered. For graphics charts this last chart will be set
to the initial chart or whatever animation situation was saved via the 'o' key.
Perhaps the most useful ability of the set chart however is that it will set
itself to times that appear in -t and -d transit and aspect in day searches.
For example, if you want to cast a chart for the New Moon this August, first do
a combination like -qd 8 18 2020 -d -R0 Sun Moo -A 1, which will scan the 18th
for Conjunctions involving the Sun and Moon, and display the time. Before, to
get a New Moon chart one would then have to manually specify the time
displayed. Now, just -i set will bring it up!</p>

<p class=C>The initial contents of the previous chart, i.e. what you get by
directly doing something like astrolog -i set are initialized to the
astrological chart for the release of this version 7.10 of the program
itself, which is the time of the Libra/Aries Full Moon, specifically for 2:05:15pm
PDT (7 hours before UTC) on Thursday, October 1, 2020 for Seattle, WA (122W19:59,
47N36:35).</p>

<p class=C>This is one more virtual file thats obscure and only useful in
certain circumstances, named nul which may be passed to the -i file input or
-r switches which take chart info files for parameters. The file nul means to
not change the chart info parameters any, but rather leave them with whatever
current settings they may have or were set to before. This is mainly useful
with the -r switches if you don't want to have to create two actual files to
pass in, or use the virtual file tty and have to enter in data interactively.
For example, to see what your biorhythm is like for the beginning of December,
do astrolog -qm 12 2020 -rb nul yourchart.as on the command line and no
further input is needed.</p>

<p class=B>Note that specification of command switch files doesnt require the
default .as extension. For example, -i mychart is equivalent to -i
mychart.as, and the program will check both names before saying a file doesnt
exist.</p>

<p class=B>If the program is invoked with a single parameter that doesnt look
like a command switch (e.g. astrolog file.as) and that parameter exists as a
file, then the command line will be converted to a parameter being passed to
the -i switch (e.g. astrolog -i file.as). This is not only a convenience, but
is also needed internally because the Windows Open verb is implemented by
launching the program and passing it the file as a parameter.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-i[2,3,4] &lt;file&gt;:</span> Load chart info into
chart slots 2, 3, or 4.</p>

<p class=B>If the -i chart file load switch is invoked as -i2, it will do the
same thing as -i except put the chart info into the second chart slot, for
use with relationship charts. This does not enter or leave any relationship
chart mode. One can set what chart info each wheel ring in the tri-wheel and
quad-wheel charts will contain by putting a number after the -i switch to load
the chart info from a file into that slot, where -i3 will load into the third
slot, and -i4 into the fourth (where -i2 will again load into the second, and
-i1 or just -i into the first). One can also do -it to load into the transiting
time (which is normally set by parameters to transit chart selection switches
such as -t, -T, and -V), and do -is to load into the previous chart slot
(which is normally looked at as an input parameter, namely the virtual file
named set).  </p>

<p class=B>There are special virtual files named __1 through __4 which
represent the current contents of the four chart slots, which can be passed to
this and other switches that read in chart files. These virtual files can be
used to copy chart date/time fields. For example, the command switch -i2 __4
will copy the contents of chart #4 to chart #2. Theres an additional virtual
file named __t which represents the transiting time.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog assumes the Gregorian calendar when inputting and
displaying dates after October 15, 1582, and the Julian calendar for dates
before then. In obscure cases, one might want the Julian calendar in effect
later or the Gregorian calendar earlier. The -ig switch is like -i, but will
read chart data into variables which indicate the date to use for the start of
the Gregorian calendar. The virtual file __g can be used to access the
current crossover date. For example, -qd Mar 1 1700 -ig nul will have the
Gregorian calendar start on March 1, 1700, as it did in Germany.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-o &lt;file&gt; [..]:</span> Write parameters of
current chart to file.</p>

<p class=B>The program supports directing chart information to, and reading output
from, data files. The '-o' option will dump all the birth data (the date and
location, not the planet positions) to the specified file. The '-i' option will
cast the chart based on the info in the file. (This allows you to put your
birth data into a specific file, and cast your chart whenever you want to after
that without having to reenter your birth data all the time.) Note that double
quote characters in the name or location fields will be converted to single
quotes when saved.</p>

<p class=B>Another file output feature, the ability to concatenate comment
lines at the end of a data file, is included with both the -o and -o0 options,
as you may wish to say keep track of info other than the program supported name
and city. After scanning the filename, the -o[0] option will then write any
parameter that follows it at the end of the file, until a parameter beginning
with a '-' or '/' (the next obvious command switch) is reached. For example: -o
&lt;file&gt; &quot;Birth certificate&quot; Family, will add extra info
indicating the source of my birth data, and a general category for the chart,
in two separate lines at the end of the file. (On most systems, quotes can be
used to allow spaces within one parameter.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-o0 &lt;file&gt; [..]:</span> Like -o but output
planet/house positions.</p>

<p class=B>Ability to write the actual sign and house positions of a chart to a
file (instead of just the time and place) has been implemented via the -o0
&lt;file&gt; option. This option can be used interchangeably with the -o output
to file switch. The information written includes the zodiac position of all
unrestricted objects, their retrograde velocity, latitude, and distance, as
well as the positions of the house cusps. (The chart name strings as set with
the -zi switch are written out too of course.) This file information can easily
be passed into another program, and can be read back into Astrolog with the -i
option. The -i option will automatically determine which type the file is, and
will either use the given positions, or else calculate them as needed. (Note
that some switches, such as the -c house system selection, will have no effect
for this file type.) Check an example of one of these files to see the precise
format (a zodiac position is recorded as three numbers: degree in sign, sign as
number 1 through 12 or three letter abbreviation, and floating point minute
within the degree.) When the files are read back in, they will be flagged as having
no space or time like the composite charts in the chart header displays.</p>

<p class=B>This file format can allow one to do things such as transits to
composite charts (send the composite chart to file with -o0 option and then
read in the file with -i when using the -t switch) composites between two
composite charts (use -rc between two composite charts sent to a file) and
even, if one is willing to do a small amount of editing, to do transits to
midpoints or the 0 degrees Aries point. Note that one can easily edit the
positions in the -o0 position file to be whatever they like, so one could
replace some unimportant object (e.g. the Vertex) with 0 degrees Aries or an
important midpoint value. Note that trying to still use the -o time and space
output with a chart in memory that doesn't have time/space will output the
time/space of the most recent chart data used.</p>

<p class=B>Note for old style -o0 position files created before version 4.20
that aren't based on command lines (see -Yo switch later): the positions of the
eight Uranians may be output to those planet position files in addition to the
20 main objects, but only if the Uranians are actually calculated with -u in
effect. Hence those position files can be of two different lengths, but the
program will be able to read in both formats, leaving the Uranians
uninitialized at 0Aries if they aren't also in the file.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-od &lt;file&gt;:</span> Output program's current
settings to switch file.</p>

<p class=B>This switch will output program settings to the specified file, or
in other words generate the contents of astrolog.as. It duplicates the effect
of the File / Save Settings menu command in the Windows version.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-os &lt;file&gt;, &gt; &lt;file&gt;:</span> Redirect
output of text charts to file.</p>

<p class=B>This switch, given a file, will output the contents of a text chart
to that file. This is just like output redirection (i.e. &gt; textfile at the
end of a command line) except that its implemented within the program. Hence unlike
output redirection it will work from within a -Q loop, from the File Run menu
in Microsoft Windows, and on systems whose shells don't allow redirection at
all. This also has the advantage in that prompts and user messages won't be
sent to the file, hence things can be done such as astrolog -os textfile,
where the program will still prompt you on the screen for the chart info, but
the chart itself will still go to the file.</p>

<p class=B>The -os switch may also be expressed as -&gt;, which is included as
a convenience with its similarity to the &gt; output redirection featured in
many shells. As with all switches, one may leave off the dash and invoke it as
just &gt;. When just &gt; is included on the command line, the systems own
output redirection will tend to be used. This switch allows one to also include
&gt; when prompted for command lines within the program, or when running from
MS Windows, where the shell plays no part.</p>

<p class=Section2>Switches which affect what information is used in a chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-R [&lt;obj1&gt; [&lt;obj2&gt; ..]]:</span> Restrict
specific bodies from displays.</p>

<p class=B>The ability to restrict the transit (-t) and daily aspect (-d) scans
to just certain bodies has been implemented with the -R switch. Using -R by
itself will prevent the asteroids, Chiron, Lilith, the Part of Fortune, East Point, and the Vertex from being in any of the charts. One may also give a list of one
or more numbers representing planets to be ignored (e.g. 1 = Sun, 2 = Moon, 3 =
Mercury, etc) or specify planet abbreviations directly, so that a complete
custom setup can be obtained (e.g. -R 1 2 3 4 5 or -R sun moo mer ven mar will
cause all of the inner planets to be ignored). More than one -R switch can be
combined (e.g. -R -R 16 will cause the asteroids, etc, and the North Node to be
ignored; the first -R gets rid of the asteroids, etc, and the second one
deletes the North Node.) Also, specifying the same particular body more than
once will cause it to be included again, or in other words, -R
&lt;objectnum&gt; complements the status of whether it is to be ignored or not
(e.g. -R -R 15 will cause all of the asteroids, etc, excluding Vesta, to be
ignored; the first -R makes causes the asteroids to be ignored, and specifying
Vesta in the second -R makes it reappear.)</p>

<p class=B>Note that Astrolog will compute charts faster when objects are
restricted, since it doesn't bother to compute locations that aren't needed or
used. For example, the search of a year for a Solar Return (-i chart -ty year
-R0 sun -RT0 sun) is about twice as fast than when the restrictions are
omitted, since were only looking at Sun locations.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-R0 [&lt;obj1&gt; ..]:</span> Like -R but restrict
everything first.</p>

<p class=B>The -R0 option will cause all bodies to be restricted, which is
useful if you are looking for just the transits/aspects of a few planets (e.g.
-R0 6 7 will cause everything but Jupiter and Saturn to be ignored.) Combining
all these methods can cause whatever you are looking for in transits and
aspects to be quickly found without having to wade through lots of data you
aren't interested in.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-R1 [&lt;obj1&gt; ..]:</span> Like -R0 but unrestrict
and show all objects.</p>

<p class=B>This will unconditionally unrestrict all planets and other objects
used by the program, which is a complement to the -R0 switch above which
restricts everything. Note that this will also set modes, in that it does
automatically activate the -C, -u, and -U sets of objects.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-R[C,u,U]:</span> Restrict all minor cusps, all Uranians,
or stars.</p>

<p class=B>These three switches are similar to the -R0 option in that they
initially restrict objects, i.e. all the minor cusps, Uranians, and fixed
stars, respectively from appearing. For example, if you want to include only
the star Sirius in a window chart without having to also include all the other
stars (or having to enter a very long restriction list), do: astrolog =RU Sir
-X, which will include restrict all stars except Sirius, before making the
chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-RT[0,1,C,u,U] [..]:</span> Restrict transiting
planets in -t lists.</p>

<p class=B>Transiting planets may be restricted from charts independently of
those planets being transited to. In -T charts, the -R option only affects the
natal planets. To restrict transiting planets, one must use the -RT option. The
-RT option is exactly like -R, and any subswitches of -R can be used with -RT
as long as the 'T' immediately follows the 'R'. For example, -RT by itself
restricts transiting asteroids from appearing in -T charts, -RT0 restricts all
transiting bodies, -RTu restricts the Uranians, and so on. This is a really
useful feature, and allows one to pretty much be able to generate exactly and
only those transits one is interested in. For example, if you want to see if
anything is transiting your natal Jupiter or natal Saturn this month, do: astrolog
-i yourchart -T 3 1993 -R0 6 7. If you want to see if Chiron is transiting
anything this year (excluding asteroids), do: astrolog -i yourchart -Ty 1993
-RT0 11 -R. If you are only interested in transits of outer planets to your
Sun or Moon, do: astrolog -i yourchart -T 3 1993 -RT0 6 7 8 9 10 -R0 1 2, and
so on. By default, only the transiting Moon is restricted. To get it back,
merely unrestrict it with -RT 2. These default transit restrictions are in
the astrolog.as defaults file described later, and are right after the standard
restriction table, both of which may be modified however you please.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-RA [&lt;asp1&gt; ..]:</span> Restrict specific
aspects from displays.</p>

<p class=B>The -RA switch will restrict the given aspect or list of aspects
from appearing in charts, like how the -R switch does for objects. (Note that
an aspect can also be restricted by giving it a negative orb.) As with object
restrictions, aspects can be forced on or off independent of their previous
state with the _ or = switch prefixes. Aspect restrictions are
automatically linked with the -A switch aspect count setting. In other words,
increasing the aspect count will automatically unrestrict uncovered aspects,
and decreasing it will automatically restrict covered aspects. Also, manually
restricting or unrestricting aspects will automatically adjust the aspect count
to be the highest unrestricted aspect.</p>

<p class=B>If -RA is invoked as -RA0 it will restrict all aspects. (This is
similar to the -R0 switch which restricts all objects, and is equivalent to
doing -A 0.) Similarly, if -RA is invoked as -RA1 it will unrestrict and show
all aspects. (This is similar to the -R1 switch which restricts all objects,
and is equivalent to doing -A 18 after -A 0).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-RO &lt;obj&gt;:</span> Require object to be present
in aspects.</p>

<p class=B>A reverse restriction is a required object that must be present in
charts involving aspects between planets. For example, if you want to see only
aspects or transits involving Mars (such as Mars Trine Venus, and Mars Trine
Jupiter, but not Venus Trine Jupiter) then Mars is considered required. If the
object parameter is -1, None, or the empty string, that will turn this option
off and not have a required object. In addition to actual aspects, this setting
will affect the aspect configurations included after the text mode aspect grid
(-g0 switch). It will also affect the midpoints included in the midpoint list
(-m switch), although it wont restrict which aspects are displayed to those
midpoints (-ma switch).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-C:</span> Include angular and non-angular house cusps
in charts.</p>

<p class=B>This option must be indicated to include the 12 actual house cusps
(i.e. Ascendant, et al) in the various chart options, such as the -g aspect
grids, -t transit searches, the graphics wheel chart, etc. This option won't
have any effect on certain charts where only physical bodies are shown (e.g.
-Z, -S, -L) or where all house cusps are already indicated in the chart (e.g.
-v, -w). The house cusps technically have actual object indexes like the
planets, and are objects 22 through 33 in order (add 22 to a house to get its
index). You can deal with and restrict these individually for transit and other
charts, e.g. to turn on just the Ascendant and MC, do -C -RC 22 31. Cusp
objects (along with Uranians and fixed stars below) are integrated with object
restrictions. In other words, restricting all objects in a category will turn
the category as a whole off, and unrestricting an object within a category will
turn the category on. Concerning rulerships, each cusp object is set to rule the
sign corresponding to it (e.g. Ascendant rules Aries) while each cusp exalts
in the next sign after it of the same element (e.g. Ascendant exalts in Leo).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-u:</span> Include transneptunian/Uranian bodies in
charts.</p>

<p class=B>Display the locations of the Uranian planets with the -u switch.
Transneptunian or Uranian planets are an interesting subset of astrology which
includes various objects alleged to be beyond Pluto. (Do: astrolog -u -HO to
list the nine Uranian bodies.) Astrolog will include the zodiac positions of
these planets if one includes this option, and will print their positions after
the main planets, or include them in the other chart types.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog supports the position of Vulcan, a hypothetical planet
located inside Mercurys orbit. Vulcan is significant in Esoteric Astrology,
and is computed according to the research of L.H. Weston. Vulcan is stored
within the Uranian group of objects (which are also hypothetical planets). That
means this switch will include Vulcan along with the eight actual Uranians.
Computing Vulcan requires the Swiss Ephemeris routines to be active, and it
will be placed at 0Aries otherwise. The orbital formula for Vulcan is defined
in the file seorbel.txt in the Astrolog install directory, and like the
larger ephemeris files that text file needs to be present in order for Vulcan
to be computed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-U:</span> Include locations of fixed background stars
in charts.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog has the ability to display the positions of 47 of the
brightest and most important stars in the sky. To include these stars in a
chart, use the -U universe option. The 43 brightest stars, i.e. all those
with apparent magnitude values &lt; 2.0 are included, in addition to four
dimmer stars which are considered significant, i.e.: Polaris the North star,
the Pleiades (specifically the star Pleione within it) star cluster (home of
our extraterrestrial cousins), Zeta Reticuli (home of the Grey aliens), and the
Andromeda (M31) Galaxy (closest galaxy to our own Milky Way, and home to
various extraterrestrial hierarchies). One bright star is called Orion, which
is formally Alnilam, the middle star of Orions belt. Since stars are mostly fixed
in the sky, they wont change position in the -s sidereal zodiac, although they
will slowly precess forward in the standard tropical zodiac. Stars will move
slightly between geocentric and heliocentric positions, based on the parallax
effect produced by Earth orbiting around the Sun. The -R restriction option can
be used to determine which stars are actually included, although the -U option will
enable them all at once. With on screen graphics, the stars are labeled by
three letter abbreviations, and are colored according to their brightness:
orange for stars brighter than (less than) magnitude 1.0, and dark red for the
dimmer remaining stars with magnitudes greater than this value.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-U[z,l,n,b,d,v]:</span> Sort stars by zodiac position,
latitude, name, brightness, distance, or zodiac position velocity.</p>

<p class=B>In places where stars are printed sequentially, such as the -v
standard chart, -Z horizon chart, -S space chart, and in the -HO and -HS object
lists, it can sometimes be confusing to locate the star you want among 46
others. The -U option can be modified to sort the stars in various ways. Note
that star ordering will have no visible effect in graphics charts, and one must
still use the default ordering when passing numbers to the -R switch to
restrict star objects.</p>

<p class=B>-Uz: Sort stars by their zodiac position.<br>
-Ul: Sort stars by their ecliptic latitude from highest in the celestial sphere
to lowest.<br>
-Un: Alphabetize the stars by name.<br>
-Ub: Stars will be listed in order from brightest to dimmest.<br>
-Ud: Sort stars by distance from the viewer. Note that determining star distances
requires Swiss Ephemeris to be the calculation method, and older calculation
methods will assume all stars are exactly 100 light years away from our Sun.<br>
-Uv: Sort stars by their longitudinal velocity. Note that determining star velocities
requires Swiss Ephemeris to be the calculation method, and older calculation
methods will assume all stars never move.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-A &lt;0-18&gt;:</span> Specify the number of aspects
to use in charts.</p>

<p class=B>If you like many aspects, or only desire the major ones, to be
included in the aspect grids, specifying -A &lt;number&gt; will limit or extend
the number of aspects (e.g. -A 2 will make charts with only conjunctions and
oppositions listed in them, while -A 18 will include all 18 aspects that
Astrolog supports.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-A3:</span> Aspects calculated by latitude combined
with zodiac position.</p>

<p class=B>3D aspects: Aspect calculations can take the latitude of the planet
into account. In other words, the angle between two planets is based on the 3D
great circle distance between them on the celestial sphere, and not just the 2D
difference between their zodiac position longitudes.</p>

<p class=B>For example, during a New Moon the Sun and Moon may be as much as 5
degrees different in latitude, which means that even when a New Moon is exact,
the 3D aspect orb between them may be up to 5 degrees. (If the Sun and Moon are
conjunct in both zodiac position and latitude, then a solar eclipse is taking
place.) For bodies with latitudes that can be widely different from the
ecliptic, such as Pluto, asteroids, and especially fixed stars, the difference is
more pronounced. For example, a body at 0Leo and -30 latitude will be Square a
body at 0Leo and +60 latitude, even though theyre both at the same longitude
and would be considered Conjunct normally.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Ap:</span> Orb limits apply to latitude as well as
zodiac position.</p>

<p class=B>3D orbs: Most astrologers and astrology software only look at a
planets zodiac longitude, and ignore any latitude, when determining whether an
aspect is within orb. When 3D orbs are on, they will prevent an aspect from
appearing if the 3D great circle distance between the pair of planets is out of
orb. That means turning 3D orbs on may cause certain aspects to no longer be
present, especially involving objects that can have very different latitudes,
such as asteroids and fixed stars. For example, a Conjunction between two
planets both exactly at 15Libra longitude wont be flagged if their latitudes
are different by more than the orb for the Conjunction aspect.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-AP:</span> Parallel aspects based on ecliptic not
equatorial positions.</p>

<p class=B>Parallel and contraparallel aspects are usually calculated relative
to equatorial declination. This switch will instead calculate parallel aspects
relative to ecliptic latitude. Note that since most planets are on or near the
ecliptic, aspect orbs should be very narrow to avoid most everything being
parallel to everything else.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Ao &lt;aspect&gt; &lt;orb&gt;:</span> Specify maximum
orb for an aspect.</p>

<p class=B>Change the default orbs of the various aspects with the -Ao
&lt;aspect&gt; &lt;orb&gt; switch. Do you not like the 7 degree orbs for
conjunctions that are used by default? Given an aspect name or index number, and
an orb value, the orb used for that particular aspect is updated accordingly.
Non-integer orb values are allowed. A negative orb value will completely
eliminate an aspect from ever appearing, although better to simply restrict the
aspect if you want to do that. For example: astrolog -Ao Opp 4 -Ao Tri -1
narrows the orb for Oppositions, and eliminates Trines, leaving all the other
aspects at the default values. Note that for very wide orbs more than one aspect
may apply for a particular angle, in which case the earlier or more fundamental
aspect is chosen.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Am &lt;planet&gt; &lt;orb&gt;:</span> Specify maximum
orb allowed to a planet.</p>

<p class=B>Ability to explicitly specify maximum orbs that any aspect can make
to a particular planet is supported with the -Am switch. This is used for
objects like the North Node which require narrower orbs than what the aspects
themselves normally allow. The -Am switch takes two parameters: the first to
indicate the index of the object, and the second to indicate what the maximum
orb allowed to it will be. By default, the only objects with restriction are
the Node, Part of Fortune, Vertex, and fixed stars, which allow a 2 degree max
orb to them. With this option, one can change these limits or impose restrictions
for other planets too. Note all stars use the maximum orb given to the first
star (object #43), and object indexes beyond the first star arent allowed for
this switch. The astrolog.as settings file will read in these default planet
orbs for all objects.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Ad &lt;planet&gt; &lt;orb&gt;:</span> Specify orb
addition given to a planet.</p>

<p class=B>Ability to widen an aspect orb for any planet is supported with the
-Ad switch. This is used for objects like the Sun and Moon for which one might
want wider orbs to them than what the aspects themselves allow. Like the -Am
switch, this -Ad switch takes two parameters: the first to indicate the object,
and the second to indicate how much wider orbs allowed to it will be. By
default, the only objects which have orbs widened for them are the Sun and
Moon, each of which adds one degree to the orb of any aspect to it. With this
option, one can change these additions or allow other objects to have them,
too. It can also be used for moiety type aspect orbs which vary based on
planet instead of aspect. (To do this, set all aspect orbs to zero with -Ao,
and then for each planet set -Ad to half its moiety orb). Note all stars use
the orb addition given to the first star (object #43), and object indexes
beyond the first star arent allowed for this switch. The astrolog.as file will
also read in defaults for these orb additions for all planets. (Note that these
object orb additions can be added to a negative orb for an aspect making it
valid, so if you really want to restrict an aspect with -Ao, it should be a
large enough negative value so that the sum of any additions between two
objects won't make it go positive.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Aa &lt;aspect&gt; &lt;angle&gt;:</span> Change the
actual angle of an aspect.</p>

<p class=B>This option is used to change the actual angle of a particular
aspect. This is useful if one wants to search for some unusual angle not
already available in Astrologs aspects or accessible through the -x harmonic
charts. For example, if I want to know when any planet enters a 2.5 degree orb
of any planet in my natal chart, I would do a transit search along with -Aa 1
2.5, where 1 is the index of the conjunction aspect, and 2.5 means the conjunction
is now exact when any two objects are 2 degrees and 30 minutes apart.</p>

<p class=Section2>Switches which affect how a chart is computed:</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-b:</span> Use ephemeris files for more accurate
location computations.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog uses the accurate Swiss Ephemeris to compute the positions
of objects. These include the planets, the Moon and its nodes and Lilith,
Chiron and the asteroids, and the Uranians and Vulcan. Swiss Ephemeris is also
used to compute fixed stars and house cusps. The Swiss Ephemeris (version 2.09.03,
with modifications to support planetary moons) is a compressed version of NASAs
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) DE431 ephemeris, and reproduces it with 0.001
arc seconds precision.</p>

<p class=B>The ephemeris files used by the Swiss Ephemeris cover 10,000 years.
Three different files cover each date range, which are named se*.se1, in
which se stands for Swiss Ephemeris. The files sepl*.se1 cover the
planets (pl stands for planets), the files semo*.se1 cover the Moon (mo stands
for Moon), and the files seas*.se1 cover the asteroids and Chiron (as stands
for asteroids). The last three digits in an ephemeris filename indicate the
date range covered, which consists of six centuries starting with the number
indicated, in which _ means a positive year, and m means minus or negative
years BC. Note since there is no year 0 (1 BCE/BC is followed by 1 CE/AD)
negative ephemeris file ranges are offset by 1 year. The three files
se*_18.se1 cover the years 1800 through 2400 AD, which is good for most
modern purposes and take up 2012K of space. These three files are included in
the standard setup of Astrolog. For users who want to cover more years, the
complete set of files is available online. The following is a list of the years
covered by each ephemeris file:</p>

<p class=FB>Files seplm54.se1 / semom54.se1 / seasm54.se1 cover -5401 BC -
-4801 BC.</p>

<p class=FB>Files sepl_24.se1 / semo_24.se1 / seas_24.se1 cover  2400 AD -

4800 AD.</p>

<p class=FB>Files sepl_48.se1 / semo_48.se1 / seas_48.se1 cover  4800 AD - 
5400 AD.</p>

<p class=B>There is a flag to Use ephemeris files in the astrolog.as file,
which when set will always use the Swiss Ephemeris routines and is the same as
just including -b all the time, in which case -b will toggle them back off.
There is a compile time option #define SWISS in the astrolog.h header file which
can be commented out to disable the -b switch and the new formulas (although
theres little reason to ever want to do that, of course).</p>

<p class=B>If a chart is cast for a date without the required ephemeris files,
an error message will be displayed (only one error message per chart, to avoid
a long string of errors when doing charts like transit searches and ephemeris
tables). Then, the program will fall back to using a less accurate internal
ephemeris and formulas by Steve Moshier. The Moshier ephemeris is based on the
JPL DE404 ephemeris, which covers 6000 years (-3000 BCE/BC to 3000 CE/AD), and
computes planets to within 0.1 arc seconds, and the Moon within 3 arc seconds. Note
that the position of Chiron is only available for 3975 years at most, from Jan
1, 675 through Dec 31, 4649, regardless of ephemeris files available. Thats
because outside those dates Chirons orbit becomes impossible to accurately
determine, due to close encounters with Saturn. Attempting to cast a chart for
Chiron outside of this range with Swiss Ephemeris will display an error and
place it at 0Aries.</p>

<p class=B>When Swiss Ephemeris is active, the program also uses it for
calculating house cusps, including the Ascendant, Midheaven, and related
variables. That changes the position of the Ascendant and house cusps by
several arc seconds in most charts, in comparison to when Swiss Ephemeris is
disabled. Its a minor effect, since on average house cusps change 15 arc seconds
every clock second, however the slight improvement in accuracy is still
present.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-b0:</span> Display locations and times to the nearest
second.</p>

<p class=B>The ability to display zodiac positions to the arc second is
supported with the -b0 switch. Without this, positions are displayed only to
the arc minute (which used to be all that was useful due to the lesser accuracy
of older calculation methods). With the Swiss Ephemeris routines accurate to
within an arc second, this switch will turn on the more precise display.</p>

<p class=B>When this setting is on, the planet and house positions in the -w
text wheel chart, and the sidebar positions in graphic wheel charts, will be to
the nearest second. The -g text mode aspect and midpoint grids will have an
extra row for the zodiac arc second of the orb or midpoint position. The -Z
local space chart will display the altitude and azimuth to the nearest second,
while the other three vector columns will be displayed with an extra digit of
precision. The -S orbital position chart will have all five of its columns
displayed to an extra four digits of precision. The -L0 astro-graph chart with
latitude crossings will display the latitude crossing intersections to the
nearest second. The -Zd switch rising and setting chart will display the zenith
and nadir altitudes, and the horizon azimuths to the nearest second.</p>

<p class=B>Finally the standard -v listing will display the zodiac positions
and latitudes to the nearest second, and the velocity values will have an extra
four digits of precision. Note however this doesn't leave room to the right
anymore for the house cusp positions and element table normally shown. They
will be left out for -b0, however when the -C switch is in effect, the house
cusp positions will be displayed in their own separate rows, which normally
isn't ever done since theres always the list to the side. Also, -b0 combined
with -v will display an extra column at the end showing the velocity of a
planets motion along the vertical latitude axis (which is used to compute
applying/separating parallel aspects). This will be shown in the last column if
the parallel aspects setting is off, otherwise it will show the decan positions
of each object, allowing viewing of each planet alongside its decan without
having to actually change positions with the -3 switch.</p>

<p class=B>Also with this setting, all clock times will include seconds. Exact
times in the -d Transits In Day search list, the -t Transit To Natal search
list, and the -Zd Rising and Setting Times list will all be displayed to the
second, instead of just to the minute. This will also affect the time and
location values in chart header text.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-bs:</span> Use less accurate Moshier formulas instead
of Swiss Ephemeris.</p>

<p class=B>When ephemeris files are unavailable, the Swiss Ephemeris
automatically falls back to using a slightly less accurate internal ephemeris
and formulas by Steve Moshier. The Moshier ephemeris is based on the JPL DE404
ephemeris, which covers 6000 years (-3000 BCE/BC to 3000 CE/AD), and computes
planets to within 0.1 arc seconds, and the Moon within 3 arc seconds. The -bs
switch will force Astrolog to use the Moshier ephemeris, even if the more
accurate ephemeris files are available.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-bp:</span> Use less accurate Placalc files instead of
Swiss Ephemeris.</p>

<p class=B>Older versions of Astrolog used the Placalc ephemeris, which is less
accurate and covers fewer years then the Swiss Ephemeris. The older ephemeris
is still available with this switch. Theres little reason for the average user
to ever need or want to do this. The old ephemeris routines are still available
for obscure situations such as comparing accuracy of different calculation
methods, testing against previous version output with known positions, or a
need to run Astrolog in limited disk space environments. (The Placalc ephemeris
is 4.8 megabytes total or 57K per century, while Swiss Ephemeris is 37.1
megabytes or 344K per century.)</p>

<p class=B>Placalcs accuracy is about the same as Mark Pottengers CCRS routines,
and those used in Nova (it even fixes some accuracy problems Nova has, in some
of its earlier versions at least). Placalcs integrated outer planet positions
represent the standard of the Nautical Almanac, the international astronomical
standard, as published in the Astronomical Almanac, for its computations as
computed before 1984. (Since 1984 the standard has been the DE200 integrations
by JPL.) The Suns position implements the Newcomb theory for all terms &gt;
0.01&quot;, the positions of Mercury through Mars are done to all terms &gt; 0.05&quot;,
while Browns improved lunar ephemeris is used such that the Moon is within 3&quot;
of DE200. For the asteroids, at the conclusion of the integration process
computing their files, the uncertainty error had reached 8.0E-11 AU after
CPJV_29, and 4.9E-10 AU after CPJV_m2. Placalcs fraction of second precision,
is of course much more accurate when compared to the Matrix positions, which
are only accurate to about one minute (and several degrees for Chiron, as well
as the four asteroids) for the 20th century only. For example, at 1800 CE/AD,
the Matrix positions for the outer planets are off by 2 degrees, and about 1
degree for 2100; by 1500 CE/AD, Matrix is off by 14 degrees for Pluto while
Chiron is barely in the right hemisphere any more.</p>

<p class=B>Placalc uses ephemeris files for some planets which must be in a
directory specified at compile time or covered by one of the environment
variables in order to be found. The advanced routines are valid based on how
many of the ephemeris files one has. With all of them, the formulas will cover
and deliver accurate positions for nearly 8500 years from -5260 BCE/BC through
3237 CE/AD. There are 95 ephemeris files total. Each file covers a range of
100,000 days, or about 273 years. Altogether they take up 4.8 megabytes of disk
space, but each segment of 273 years only takes up 150K. For each time segment,
there is an ephemeris file named LRZ5_n containing the positions of Jupiter
through Pluto (at 80 day increments), a file CHI_n containing the positions
of Chiron, and a file CPJV_n containing the positions of the four asteroids.
The 'n' refers to the span of Julian Days covered by it (divided by 100000).
For example, Julian Days 1,200,000 through 1,300,000 are in the files LRZ5_12,
CHI_12, and CPJV_12 (the 'm' character in some files refers to
negative/minus Julian Days). You don't need all the files to use -bp, just
those that cover the dates you want to use. If you try to use -bp with a date
not covered by an available ephemeris file, a warning message will be printed
and the old Matrix formulas will be used. (Only one error is displayed for each
chart until control returns to the user, to prevent potentially numerous errors
from tables involving multiple charts such as transit searches.) The files LRZ5_24,
CHI_24, and CPJV_24 cover the years 1859 through 2131 CE/AD, which is good
for most modern purposes and only take up 150K of space. (These three files are
included in the standard zip archive release file of Astrolog. For users who
want to cover more years, the complete set of files is available online.) The
following is a list of the precise dates covered by each ephemeris file:</p>

<p class=B>Note that because the asteroid ephemeris files were first introduced
in a version after those for the other planets, meaning one may not yet have
CPJV_n files for dates they have the other files for, there is an undocumented
switch called -ba, which is like -bp but will still compute the asteroids using
the Matrix formulas.</p>

<p class=B>Note that this calculation method is not compatible with allowing
the -v0 switch to express planetary velocities relative to average speed work
with it, and nor will central planetary bodies other than the Sun or Earth
(standard geocentric and heliocentric charts) via -h work. It will however
display velocities for the Moon and the Nodes, which aren't available with the
Matrix routines.</p>

<p class=B>Special thanks to Dr. Alois Treindl who kindly allowed the Placalc
formulas to be used in Astrolog. Mr. Treindl is the founder and owner of
Astrodienst Zurich, second largest astrological computer service in Europe, and is well known for his work with Liz Greene. Astrolog basically treats the
Placalc routines as a library which we link into, in that code that knows about
both programs is kept to a minimum.</p>

<p class=B>Special thanks also to Mr. Paul Schlyter, of the Swedish Amateur
Astronomers Society (SAAF, or in Swedish: Svensk Amat|rAstronomisk F|rening),
for providing ephemeris files for the four asteroids, by writing a utility
which does the integration process to determine the positions, and that
conveniently output files in the Placalc format. Note that the requirements for
use of those asteroid files are the same as that of the rest of Astrolog.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-bm:</span> Use inaccurate Matrix formulas when
ephemeris unavailable.</p>

<p class=B>If the Swiss Ephemeris and Placalc are disabled or not compiled in,
then Astrolog will use a very old set of formulas that dont include external
ephemeris files, based on routines originally designed by Matrix Software. The
old Matrix formulas are only accurate to about one arc minute for the 20th
century. The Uranian objects are less accurate in the Matrix routines too.
Their zodiac positions may vary up to 10 arc minutes, and their latitudes
(which will always be fixed at 0) may vary by up to 59 arc minutes. This switch
allows these formulas to still be used. When this setting is off, the Matrix
formulas will never be used no matter what, in which case the lack of ephemeris
files will result in planets being at 0Aries. That may be desired behavior, to
ensure only the best Swiss Ephemeris positions are ever in place. Many may
prefer the error condition of no positions, to relatively inaccurate and
potentially misleading positions. Theres little reason for the average user to
ever need or want to turn this on, although some features like defining your
own orbital elements (via the -YE switch) make use of the simple Matrix
formulas.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-bU:</span> Use inaccurate Matrix formulas for fixed
stars only.</p>

<p class=B>The Swiss Ephemeris is also used for computing the positions of
fixed stars. Star positions are taken from the file sefstars.txt that comes
with Astrologs installation. Stars can be computed without Swiss Ephemeris
with the -bU command switch. Theres little reason to not use Swiss Ephemeris,
although fixed stars are computed slightly faster via the older and less
accurate method.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-c &lt;value&gt;:</span> Select a different system of
house division. 0 = Placidus, 1 = Koch, 2 = Equal, 3 = Campanus, 4 = Meridian,
5 = Regiomontanus, 6 = Porphyry, 7 = Morinus, 8 = Topocentric, 9 = Alcabitius,
10 = Krusinski, 11 = Equal (Midheaven), 12 = Pullen Sinusoidal Ratio, 13 =
Pullen Sinusoidal Delta, 14 = Whole, 15 = Vedic, 16 = Sripati, 17 = Horizon, 18
= APC, 19 = Carter Poli Equatorial, 20 = Sunshine, 21 = Null.</p>

<p class=B>22 different house systems are supported in the program: Invoke as
astrolog -c &lt;number&gt; to change the system from the default of Placidus. Note
that in the Campanus, Regiomontanus, Topocentric, and Sunshine house systems,
at high latitudes their houses are sometimes arranged in reverse order. Also note
that the Placidus and Koch systems aren't defined for polar locations inside
the Arctic and Antarctic circles. If the user attempts to cast a chart using
them with a latitude beyond about 66 degrees N or S, the program will fall back
to Porphyry houses. Similarly, most house systems are still defined at extreme
latitudes (inside the Arctic or Antarctic circles) but have the condition where
the natural formulas for the MC and Asc at those locations would put the Asc in
the 180 degrees before instead of after the MC. In such a case Astrolog
preserves the Midheaven, and flips the Ascendant if need be to ensure the other
house cusps will remain sane.</p>

<p class=B>House system number 11 is the Midheaven based Equal house system.
This is just like the more common standard Equal house system (-c 2) except
that we start with the 10th cusp being the same as the MC and disassociate the
1st cusp from the Ascendant, instead of starting with the 1st cusp being the
same as the Ascendant and disassociating the 10th cusp from the MC.</p>

<p class=B>House indexes 12 and 13 are the Pullen sinusoidal systems of house
division. They are relatively new systems similar to Porphyry houses, except theyre
smooth around the zodiac with the MC/Asc ratio or difference being spread in
a continuous sinusoidal manner from expanded to compressed quadrants. For more
information about these systems and why they can be considered the best
looking house systems for wheel charts, see: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/astsine.htm">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/astsine.htm</a>.</p>

<p class=B>House system 14 is the Whole system of houses, where the first cusp
is at zero degrees of the sign of the Ascendant, and the others are all at the
beginning of the succeeding signs. This is basically the same as the Equal
system with all positions shifted back to the start of their sign. Thanks to
Andy Gray for telling me about this system and how its computed.</p>

<p class=B>House system 15 is the Vedic or Vehlow system of houses, or more
specifically the modern India style of Equal houses. In this system, each house
covers 30 degrees, and the Ascendant is always in the middle of the first
house, i.e. the 1st cusp is always 15 degrees before the Ascendant. (For
contrast, the ancient or traditional India style of equal houses are already
supported in Astrolog by the Whole house system above, where the first house
cusp is always the start of the sign the Ascendant is in.)</p>

<p class=B>House system 16 is the Sripati system of houses. This house system
is a mixture between the Vedic and Porphyry systems. Its computed the same as
Porphyry, except that each cusp starts in the middle of the previous house as
defined by the Porphyry system.</p>

<p class=B>House system 17 is the Horizon system of houses. Sometimes called
Azimuth, this system has the 10th cusp the same as the MC, however it
disassociates the 1st cusp from the Ascendant. (Meridian houses has this
property too.)</p>

<p class=B>House system 18 is APC system of houses. More fully called
Ascendant Parallel Circle, this is a quadrant based system, however it has
the interesting property that non-angular cusps arent always 180 degrees
opposite each other.</p>

<p class=B>House system 19 is the Carter Poli Equatorial system of houses.
Invented by astrologer Charles Carter (1887-1968), this system has the 1st cusp
the same as the Ascendant, however it disassociates the 10th cusp from the MC.</p>

<p class=B>House system 20 is the Sunshine system of houses. Similar to APC
houses, in Sunshine houses non-angular cusps arent always 180 degrees opposite
each other. Near the poles, Sunshine houses can have five cusps in a row
overlapping, and therefore have four houses in row zero sized.</p>

<p class=B>House system 21 is Null houses, also called Aries houses. It refers
to no houses at all, or in other words where the Ascendant will always be 0
degrees Aries, the Nadir 0 degrees Cancer, etc, which can be useful for
extended chart animations, in which having houses at all can tend to get in the
way. One can even observe the precession of the equinoxes with this system if
used in conjunction with the -s sidereal chart option.</p>

<p class=C>Astrolog also supports five theoretical equal house systems. They
dont appear as Windows menu options, and can only be selected by the command
line:</p>

<p class=C>House system 22 is Midheaven based Whole houses. Standard Whole
houses has the 1st house at the start of the sign of the Ascendant. Midheaven
based Whole houses has the 10th house at the start of the sign of the
Midheaven. This is similar to the difference between standard Equal houses
which ties the 1st house to the Ascendant, and Equal (MC) houses which ties the
10th house to the Midheaven.</p>

<p class=C>House system 23 is Midheaven based Vedic houses. Standard Vedic
houses has the Ascendant in the middle of the 1st house. Midheaven based Vedic
houses has the MC in the middle of the 10th house.</p>

<p class=C>House system 24 is Balanced Equal houses. This is a mixture between
Ascendant and Midheaven based Equal houses. Here the difference between the Asc
and MC is applied to both the 1st and 10th cusps equally, so the amount the Asc
is different from the 1st cusp is always the same as the amount the MC is
different from the 10th. On a technical level, Balanced Equal houses places the
Asc/MC midpoint in the middle of the 11th house, which ensures a balanced
distribution, as seen in this animation: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/equal.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/equal.gif</a></p>

<p class=C>House system 25 is Balanced Whole houses. Similar to Balanced Equal
houses, this is a mixture between Ascendant and Midheaven based Whole houses.
Just as Ascendant based Whole houses has the Ascendant somewhere in the 1st
house, and Midheaven based Whole houses has the Midheaven somewhere in the
10th, Balanced Whole houses ensures the Asc/MC midpoint is always in the 30
degree section half way between the 1st and 10th houses.</p>

<p class=C>House system 26 is Balanced Vedic houses. Similar to Balanced Equal
houses, this is a mixture between Ascendant and Midheaven based Vedic houses.
The end result of these five theoretical house systems combined with the four
more common existing house systems, is a 3x3 grid of nine house systems total.
Theres Equal, Whole, and Vedic along one axis. Along the other axis, each of
these concepts can be centered around the Ascendant, around the Midheaven, or
balanced between the two.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-c3:</span> Place in houses using latitude as well as
zodiac position.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog supports 3D houses, which means that a planets house
placement is determined by its ecliptic latitude in addition to its zodiac position
longitude. 3D houses is not a standard house system, since it doesnt affect
Astrologs list of house cusp objects (which are still determined by whatever
house system is active). However, 3D houses does determine which house an
object is placed within. For more details about 3D houses, see: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/ast3d.htm">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/ast3d.htm</a></p>

<p class=B>In general, houses are based on the local horizon, in which the sky
or celestial sphere is divided into 12 equally sized &quot;orange wedges&quot;,
with houses 1-6 below the horizon, and houses 7-12 above it. Similarly, houses
10-3 are to the east of the meridian, and houses 4-9 are to the west of the
meridian. The signs of the zodiac are also a set of 12 &quot;orange
wedges&quot;, however they're oriented to a different coordinate system, or
more specifically are rotated to be aligned with the ecliptic.</p>

<p class=B>Campanus is the standard house system most similar to 3D houses,
because Campanus houses are defined by the intersection of the ecliptic with
the 12 equal sized house &quot;orange wedges&quot;. That means Campanus houses
and 3D houses give the same house placements for planets exactly on the
ecliptic. Since most planets are near the ecliptic, and it's only objects like
asteroids and especially stars that are located any significant distance from
it, Campanus is a rough approximation of 3D houses. Therefore, Campanus is
probably the best house system to use with the 3D houses setting, because 3D
Campanus is basically 3D Equal houses, in which each 3D house is an equal
sized 30 degree slice of the celestial sphere. However, every standard house
system has a corresponding 3D house system in Astrolog, defined by great
circles drawn from the due South point to the due North point on the local
horizon, passing through each 2D cusp where it intersects the ecliptic. For an
example of 3D Placidus houses, see: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/placidus.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/placidus.gif</a></p>

<p class=B>When 3D houses are active, it affects charts in the following ways:</p>

<p class=C>Standard radix (-v switch): The indicating of what house a planet is
within is based on 3D houses, and not the house cusp positions of whatever
house system is active.</p>

<p class=C>Graphic wheel (-v -X switches): The positioning of planets around
the wheel is based on its proportion through the house, and not its zodiac
position. Normally the wheel is zodiac focused and a planet is placed based
on its zodiac longitude, with its latitude (and how latitude affects 3D house
placement) ignored. When 3D houses are on, the wheel is instead house
focused. That means positioning is based on the proportion a planet is through
its house, e.g. a planet 1/5 of the way through the 3rd house will be
positioned 1/5 of the way through the 3rd house in the wheel, regardless of the
planets zodiac longitude. The result is planets seem to shift slightly,
especially if their latitude is different from 0.</p>

<p class=C>Text local horizon (-Z switch): Positions will be displayed in prime
vertical mode (as with the -Z0 switch), because prime vertical coordinates
define houses, in which the azimuth or 0-360 degrees (representing house
positions 1-12) follows the prime vertical from the horizon east point through
the west point via the nadir. Similarly, the altitude or -90 to +90 degrees
ranges from the north to south points on the local horizon. In addition,
instead of a 0-360 degree number, the azimuth will be expressed as the house
position 1-12, along with the percentage the object is through the house from
0-30 degrees.</p>

<p class=C>Graphic local horizon (-Z -X switches): Both versions of the graphic
local horizon chart will have added to it an overlay of dark green lines
showing the 3D houses (with each house labeled 1-12), and dark blue lines
showing the signs (with each sign labeled with its glyph). These two sets of
overlapping orange wedges can make it clear how 3D houses differ from house
determination by zodiac longitude only.</p>

<p class=C>Graphic solar system orbit (-S -X switches): Planets will be drawn
on a logarithmic scale, resulting in planetary orbits roughly equally spaced.
One issue with the normal chart is that unless one is really zoomed in, the
inner planets are crammed together and harder to see. The Moon will be spaced
farther away from the Earth too, so it will be more visible as well. The video <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSZzytVUzgI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSZzytVUzgI</a>
shows this in action, in which the Moon can be seen orbiting the Earth, while
Earth and the other planets can be seen orbiting the Sun.</p>

<p class=C>Chart sphere (-XX switch): As with the graphic local horizon chart,
this chart has the ability to highlight house boundaries in 3D as well as 2D.
2D house boundaries share the same poles as the zodiac itself, and the size
of each houses orange wedge will be determined by the house system in
effect. In contrast, 3D house boundaries are anchored to the North and South
points on the local horizon, and at least for 3D Campanus will always be equal
sized orange wedges. Toggling the 3D houses setting while viewing the display
is an easy way to visualize the difference between 2D and 3D houses. Showing 2D
or 3D houses assumes that houses boundaries are being shown in the first place,
which is toggled by the show house details setting (-XC switch). Note that
chart spheres always draw the horizon (which the Ascendant is on) and meridian
(which the Midheaven is on), which means 3D non-quadrant systems (which
disassociate the 1st cusp from the Ascendant and/or the 10th cusp from the
Midheaven) will show 13 or 14 lines crossing the sphere instead of just 12.</p>

<p class=C>Graphic globe (-XG switch): When Modify Display setting is active
(-Xi switch) which causes the planets to be drawn over the globe at their
zenith positions, the globe will have an overlay in dark green lines showing
the ecliptic and sign wedges. This applies to both the globe showing the
Earths continents (which looks down) and the celestial sphere showing the
astronomical constellations (which looks up).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-s [..]:</span> Compute a sidereal instead of standard
tropical chart.</p>

<p class=B>With this option, the chart will be just like the normal charts as
most commonly used in Western astrology, except that all the zodiac positions
will be shifted (to be about 24 degrees earlier). This is because the option
casts sidereal charts which are based on the positions of the fixed stars (i.e.
Aries starts at the constellation Aries) rather than the seasons (i.e. Aries
starts at the Spring or Vernal Equinox.) Due to the precession of the
equinoxes the position of the Sun at the Equinoxes has been gradually
happening at an earlier point in the sidereal zodiac each year (taking about 2147
years to change signs.) Note that in the sidereal zodiac, planet velocities are
slightly lower, to align with the fact that sidereal zodiac positions are all
precessing backwards very slowly.</p>

<p class=B>This switch accepts an optional parameter of an offset for the start
of the zodiac. This value, when non-zero, will be added to all zodiac
positions, and effectively allows one to choose any starting point for the
sidereal (or tropical) zodiac, which is useful for Hindu or other systems whose
sidereal zodiacs have zero Aries at a different location than the standard
Fagan-Bradley sidereal zodiac the program uses by default. For example, -s
10.5 will add 10 degrees and 30 minutes to all zodiac positions. This value is
initialized to a zodiac offset value setting in the astrolog.as initialization
file, which is by default zero.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-sr:</span> Compute right ascension locations relative
to equator.</p>

<p class=B>This will display planetary positions relative to the Earths
equator instead of the ecliptic i.e. Earths orbit. This is the way more
commonly used in astronomy, and results in real right ascension notation,
especially when combined with the -s sidereal zodiac and -sh hours and minutes
display format. This switch makes the declination values in the standard -v
listing also relative to the equator, instead of the ecliptic latitude
displayed by default, where Declination will be printed at the head of the
column instead of Latitude. (Without this the only way to get such
information is from the zenith latitudes in the -L astro-graph chart which show
the same thing.) Note that this setting isn't fully integrated with all of
Astrologs charts; specifically it will distort the values in the -Z local
horizon and -L astro-graph charts which assume ecliptic positions, and hence
-sr shouldn't be combined with these options.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-sr0:</span> Like -sr but only display declinations
instead of latitudes.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can display vertical planet coordinates as equatorial
declination (instead of as ecliptic latitude, which is the default). To do
this, turn on the -sr0 switch (which is also available in the Windows version by
turning on Equatorial Latitudes in the Calculation Settings dialog). This is
an extension of the -sr switch, which turns on equatorial coordinates for both
longitude and latitude (but may be less useful since it distorts zodiac
position longitudes). These two settings together can cover all four
combinations of ecliptic versus equatorial coordinates. For example =sr _sr0
will result in equatorial longitudes and ecliptic latitudes, by turning on
equatorial for both and then turning off equatorial latitudes.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-s[z,h,d]:</span> Display locations as in zodiac,
hours/minutes, or degrees.</p>

<p class=B>For astronomers out there, the -sh switch will express all planetary
positions in the right ascension hours/minutes format instead of the
sign/degrees/minutes astrologers are accustomed to. This will affect how the
objects are listed in most charts, such as the -v position list, the -E text
ephemeris, and how star azimuths are displayed in the -HO list. For example, 0
degrees Aries is represented as 0 hr, 0 min; 0 Cancer goes to 6 hr, 0 min, and
so on through the 24 hour clock.</p>

<p class=B>The -sd switch will cause zodiac positions to be displayed as a
simple decimal degree number in the 360 degree circle. This setting will also apply
to longitude and latitude values in charts, including the standard -v text
chart listing and graphic wheel chart, and the -E text mode ephemeris when listing
latitudes. To return to the default of displaying as degrees and minutes within
a zodiac sign, use the -sz switch.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-h [&lt;objnum&gt;]:</span> Compute positions centered
on specified object.</p>

<p class=B>Standard astrology charts are geocentric, which means based on the
positions of the planets relative to the Earth. This option allows seeing of
the zodiac positions with respect to the Suns (or any other planets) point of
view. The -h option when invoked by itself will display a heliocentric chart,
in which the Sun in the original listing will be replaced with the Earths
position as seen from the Sun, with the other planets positions modified
accordingly. (For example, the Moon and the Moons Nodes in a heliocentric
chart will always be very close to the Earth, since theyre relatively near
together in space.) For bodies other than the Sun, this option takes a
parameter to indicate which planet to center the chart on, e.g. do -h 5 to cast
a Mars centered chart.</p>

<p class=B>The -h central planet setting even supports star objects. This means
you can cast a chart centered on another star, and see how the stars and
constellations appear from the position of that star. Stars are very far apart
from each other, and the closest star to our Sun is 4.4 light years away, or
nearly 10,000 times farther away than Neptune. As a result, from other star
systems all the planets will appear very close to the Sun (within one arc
minute or even narrower depending on the star). Note that the object
Andromeda or M31 is actually a galaxy, which means casting a chart centered
on it will actually do a chart from the perspective of another galaxy! Because
the Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 million light years away, from its point of view
all the other stars will appear very close together (within 3.5 arc minutes).</p>

<p class=B>There are a few limitations for charts other than geocentric or
heliocentric. Planet velocities will be the heliocentric position velocities,
and apparent positions that take into account the speed of light will be based
on heliocentric distances (which means using the -YT switch true positions
setting is recommended). Moon centered charts are allowed, however note that
when the old Matrix formulas are being used, the -h option won't ever affect
the Moon, which will always be displayed as seen from the Earth, no matter what
the center body is set to, since its not a formal planet.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-p &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt;:</span> Cast
secondary progressed chart for date.</p>

<p class=B>A secondary progression chart for a particular date can be cast
using the '-p &lt;month&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;year&gt;' command switch. The
precise time within the given day progressed to is midnight in the default time
zone. House cusps are progressed using the quotidian method, which means cusps
move about 360 degrees each year in the progressed chart, because they move
about 360 degrees each day in a standard chart.</p>

<p class=B>This setting to progress charts may be turned off by invoking the -p
switch as _p with the underscore reset prefix. Unlike the standard -p switch,
_p takes no parameters. This is a command switch trick only useful when doing
multiple charts in a -Q loop, or when passing extra command lines to a graphics
screen with the return key or through macros.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-p0 &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt;:</span>
Cast solar arc chart for date.</p>

<p class=B>Solar arc progressions are supported in addition to secondaries. Invoke
the -p &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt; switch as -p0 instead, and a
chart will be generated with all planets and house cusps progressed forward an
amount equal in degrees to the number of years that have passed between the
specified date and the chart in question. The -pd option here (see below)
specifies the number of days that have to pass per zodiac degree to progress
forward; by default this is 365.24219. To generate a solar arc chart for the
current moment now, invoke the -pn switch as -p0n.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-p1 &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt;: </span>Like
-p but with solar arc cusps only.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog supports a mixed progression mode in which the planets are
secondary progressed (meaning planetary positions are computed at a future
date) but house cusps are progressed by solar arc (meaning the same offset is
applied to all cusps). Use the -p1 switch to do progressions of this type.
(Note that p1 can be used in all switch contexts that p for secondary
progressions can, and p0 for solar arc progressions can.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-p[0]t &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt; &lt;time&gt;:</span>
Like -p but specify time too.</p>

<p class=B>The -pt switch is just like -p, except in addition to month/day/year
parameters for the date to progress to, it also takes a fourth parameter for
the time within the date. Progressed charts usually move so slowly that one doesnt
care about time, but time can be specified for extra precision.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-p[0]n:</span> Cast progressed chart based on current
date now.</p>

<p class=B>The -pn switch is like the -p &lt;month&gt; &lt;date&gt;
&lt;year&gt; switch except that (like the -n switch) it assumes the current
moment now to cast the progressed chart to. This is just another shorthand
convenience to see what ones progressed chart is like presently; just do:
astrolog -i file -pn.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-pd &lt;days&gt;:</span> Set num of days to progress /
day (default 365.24219).</p>

<p class=B>User definable progression rates can be specified with this option.
When using the -p progression option, Astrolog assumes you want the standard year
for a day rate of secondary progressions. By passing different values to the
-pd switch, one can change the default 365.24219 days for a day to any value
they want for some less often used method of progression. For example, one can
do -pd 7 -pn to do a week for a day, -pd -365.24219 -pn to get negative
year for day progressions, and so on. For tertiary progressions do -pd
29.530588, and for primary directions or a year per four minutes do -pd 131487.188.
(Note that -pd 1 would be the same as if no progression were done at all.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-pC &lt;days&gt;:</span> Set factor to use when
progressing cusps (default 1.0).</p>

<p class=B>The rate that progressed house cusps move (whether computed or by
solar arc) compared to the default can be specified. Use the -pC switch to set
this value. For example, Astrologs default for secondary progressions is
quotidian, which means the cusps move 360 degrees around the zodiac each day.
However, other types of progression have the cusps move the same speed as the
Sun. Change the cusp move ratio field from 1 to 365.24219 and that will
make cusps move 365.24219 times slower, which will make them move just 1 degree
per day, about the same as the Sun.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-x &lt;value&gt;:</span> Cast harmonic chart based on
specified factor.</p>

<p class=B>Harmonic charts (i.e. where all the planet positions are multiplied
by a factor and the chart recast) are supported via the -x option (e.g. -x 3
will make all trines conjunct in the chart displayed.) The parameter passed in
may be any number, including decimal or negative numbers, ranging anywhere from
1 (i.e. no harmonic factor) to 30000 for those who want to explore extreme
harmonics.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-1 [&lt;objnum&gt;]:</span> Cast chart with specified
object on Ascendant.</p>

<p class=B>The -1 &lt;obj&gt; option can be used to change the houses to force
a particular object to be on the ascendant. This is useful in casting Solar
charts or for when the time of birth is not exactly known. For example -1 2
will cast a normal chart, but the house cusps will be rotated so that the moon
is on the ascendant.</p>

<p class=B>If the -1 switch is invoked as -10, then instead of rotating house
cusps so that the Ascendant is the same as the Sun, it will rotate house cusps
so that the Ascendant is the same as the start of the Suns sign. Similarly,
the -20 switch acts like the -2 switch below, and does the same for the
Midheaven.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-2 [&lt;objnum&gt;]:</span> Cast chart with specified
object on Midheaven.</p>

<p class=B>Just as the -1 option is used to cast a chart with an object on the
Ascendant, the -2 &lt;object&gt; switch will cast a chart with the specified
object on the Midheaven. The house cusps will be rotated so that the object in
question is conjunct the 10th house cusp. As with the -1 option, if
&lt;object&gt; is not specified, the Sun will be assumed by default.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-3:</span> Display objects in their zodiac decan
positions.</p>

<p class=B>Decan displays are supported in Astrolog, and one can display a
decan influenced chart with the -3 switch. The decan theory is that each sign
in the zodiac can be divided into three parts: The first 10 degrees (i.e. the
first decan) is mainly influenced by the sign in question, the second 10
degrees (second decan) although still influenced by the sign in question is
also somewhat influenced by the next sign of the same element, while the last
decan is influenced by the third sign of the same element. The -3 switch
applied to a chart will move each object into the sign of its decan. For
example, if the Sun is at 29 degrees Aquarius and the Moon at 5 degrees Virgo,
in the resulting chart, the Sun will go to Libra (26 degrees) and the Moon will
remain in Virgo (although be at 15 degrees now since it was previously in the
middle of the first decan of Virgo.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-4 [&lt;nest&gt;]:</span> Display objects in their
(nested) dwad positions.</p>

<p class=B>Turn on a dwad transformation of planet positions with this switch.
Dwads divide each sign into 12 subsigns, similar to the 12th harmonic, however
unlike simple harmonics each subsequence starts with the current sign. Dwads
can be nested multiple levels deep, similar to a fractal: This switch takes an
optional parameter indicating how many nestings to apply, which should be a
number 0 or greater.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-f:</span> Display houses as sign positions (flip
them).</p>

<p class=B>The -f option can be used to flip the signs and houses, i.e.
display the house as a sign position and vice versa. For example having the Sun
at 26 degrees Scorpio, 2/3 way though the 10th house, will cause the resulting
Sun under the -f option to be at 20 degrees Capricorn, 26/30th the way through
the 8th house. This can be used to determine how far a planet is through a
particular house, as well as for domal chart analysis that Mark Kenski has
informed me about. Domal analysis is based on the fact that for synastry
comparisons, for example, a planet in Gemini and one in the 3rd house can be
considered related in a way similar to a conjunction.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-G:</span> Display houses based on geographic location
only.</p>

<p class=B>This switch generates a special type of locational analysis chart,
called a geodetic chart, in which the house cusps are computed from a different
source, i.e. as a function of only the longitude and latitude. This basically
gives every spot on the planet a different unique set of house cusps, and can
be used to analyze the characteristics of different areas, and their influence
on you if you insert your own planets in the houses. This type of chart was
described in the January 1992 issue of Dell Horoscope magazine, from which I
learned how to generate these charts. Basically, the Midheaven is approximately
the longitude value converted from degrees into the appropriate zodiac sign. For
example 0 degrees E goes to 0 degrees Aries, 30 degrees E goes to 0 degrees
Taurus, etc.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-J:</span> Display wheel charts in Vedic format.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can display wheel charts in Hindu or Vedic format. This
will affect both the text -w wheels and the graphic wheels. A Vedic format
wheel is identical to a standard Western wheel except: (1) The signs and houses
increase as you go clockwise instead of counterclockwise, so the entire wheel
is flipped over. (2) The chart is rotated so the left edge is always the start
of Aquarius instead of the Ascendant, putting Pisces in the upper left corner,
meaning the Ascendant is placed wherever in the wheel is appropriate. For Vedic
astrology one will probably prefer to combine this with the -w house focused
wheel chart switch so all the houses are the same size, or even display that
chart in text mode so the wheel will be a square.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-9:</span> Display objects in their zodiac navamsa
positions.</p>

<p class=B>This command switch will display the chart in the navamsa format
used in Vedic astrology. The navamsa or marriage chart is formed by applying a
formula to each planet position to get a resulting new location. This is
similar in operation to the -3 decan feature, however this divides each sign
into ninths. Specifically, to convert a position, see which ninth of a sign a
planet falls in, e.g. a planet from 0 degrees 0' to 3 degrees 20' of a sign is
in the first ninth, a planet from 3 degrees 20' to 6 degrees 40' is in the
second ninth, and so on. Take that number, and count one less than that many
signs ahead in the zodiac to get the resulting sign. The starting sign should
be Aries if the original sign was Fire, Capricorn if the original sign was
Earth, Libra if the original sign was Air, and Cancer if the original sign was
Water. A formal navamsa chart only considers signs, hence only the sign of each
planet will be changed, and the degree within each sign will be unaffected.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-F &lt;objnum&gt; &lt;sign&gt; &lt;deg&gt;:</span>
Force objects position to be value.</p>

<p class=B>The -F option is used to force a particular objects position to
always be a particular location in the zodiac. This feature can be used as an
easy way to manually include things Astrolog normally doesn't in various
charts. For example, this can be used to force the position of some minor
thing, like the Vertex, to always be the location of whatever you prefer, like
the 0 degrees Aries point, or an important midpoint. Then you can do an aspect
grid, transit search, or whatever, and calculate aspects to midpoints or transits
over midpoints. The -F switch takes three arguments: first is the index of the
object to replace, next is the sign to force it to be, and third is the degree
within the sign. For example, if I want to see if anything is making an exact
aspect today with my Sun Moon midpoint at 6Sag28, I could do astrolog -n -d -F
Nod Sag 6.4667, which would replace the North Node with my Sun Moon midpoint
in the aspect search.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Fm &lt;objnum&gt; &lt;obj1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt;:</span>
Force object's position to midpoint.</p>

<p class=B>The -Fm option will force an objects position to always be the
midpoint between two other objects. Note all -F switch forcings are applied in
object index order, so its possible to have midpoints involving other
midpoints, as long as the more complex midpoints have higher indexes.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-+ [&lt;days&gt;]:</span> Cast chart for specified num
of days in the future.</p>

<p class=B>The -+ &lt;#ofdays&gt; option will cast a normal chart, but one for
#ofdays in the future (or past if a negative value is given). One use for this
is in combination with the -n and -d options. For instance, I often invoke the
program as astrolog -n -d to see the exact times of todays aspects. However,
just before midnight I might want to see whats going to happen in the
following day, so I would do astrolog -n -d -+ 1 to see the exact times for
tomorrows aspects. The #ofdays parameter is optional, and will default to one
if left off, so the above command can be done as just astrolog -n -d -+.</p>

<p class=B>Note that for such a chart, the chart header will show the correct
date of the actual new chart, instead of the original one. For example, if today
is Nov 19, and I do astrolog -n -+ 2, then I will get the chart for two days
from now, and the chart header will display Nov 21. This has some special uses.
For example, if you want to know what the date was or will be when you are
10000 days old, do astrolog -i yourchart -+ 10000 and see what the date in
the resulting chart header is.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-- [&lt;days&gt;]:</span> Cast chart for specified num
of days in the past.</p>

<p class=B>This dash minus option is just like the dash plus (-+) option
described above, except it subtracts instead of adds the specified number of
days from any chart cast. This is only for convenience, in that -- 1 is the
same as -+ -1.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-+[m,y] [&lt;value&gt;]:</span> Cast chart for num of
months/years in future.</p>

<p class=B>The -+m switch is just like the -+ switch above except that it will
add one month (30 days) to whatever chart instead of one day. The -+y switch
will add one year (365 days) to whatever chart. The -- dash minus switch is
extended in a similar manner, in that --m and --y will do as expected. These
switches also have the optional parameter to specify how many months or years
to move forward or back.</p>

<p class=Section2>Switches for relationship and comparison charts:</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-r &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;:</span> Compute a
relationship synastry chart.</p>

<p class=B>Computing the relationship between two charts is supported. Invoke
the program as 'astrolog -r &lt;file_of_person1&gt; &lt;file_of_person2&gt;'
and the program will give you the relationship between the two charts. In other
words, the program will use the positions of person2s planets and person1s
houses. Use this with the -w option to get a wheel chart and you can do
synastry. Note that transits can be computed with this by comparing your chart
with the positions of the planets at the current moment (as in -n switch). To
make this easier, you may specify the filename now for any file and the
computer will use the current planet positions instead of looking for a like
named file. (e.g. 'astrolog -r me now' will compute transits for file 'me'.)</p>

<p class=B>Note: if the -r switch is invoked as _r with the underscore reset
prefix, any relationship mode will be canceled. Unlike the standard -r
switches, _r takes no file parameters. This is a command switch trick only
useful when doing multiple charts in a -Q loop, or when passing extra command
lines to a graphics screen with the return key or through macros. Astrologs -r
relationship chart switches set relationship chart mode, and without this theres
no easy way to return to single chart mode. Yes, when a graphics screen is up,
the 'c' key will toggle relationship comparison mode, but thats not available
from the command line.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-rc &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;:</span> Compute a
composite chart.</p>

<p class=B>The '-r' option can be used to generate composite relationship
charts. Simply invoke it as '-rc &lt;person1&gt; &lt;person2&gt;' instead of
just -r and a composite chart (i.e. composed of the midpoints of the planets,
etc. of the two charts in question) will be generated. (Note: when the house
cusps in the two charts are nearly 180 degrees apart, simply taking the
midpoints of all the cusps may result in them being out of order in the
resulting composite. In such a case we give priority to the composite
midheaven, and invert the midpoints of any of the other cusps or the Ascendant
by 180 degrees if leaving them that way would have things out of order.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-rm &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;:</span> Compute a time
space midpoint chart.</p>

<p class=B>Time and space midpoint relationship charts are supported: Doing -rm
chart1 chart2 will calculate the time and location exactly half way between
the times and locations as indicated in the two files. This type of chart is
also called a Davison chart. Unlike all other types of relationship charts,
this one actually exists in space and time, and therefore can be treated like a
single chart and can be output to a file with the -o option.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-r[c,m]0 &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; &lt;ratio1&gt;
&lt;ratio2&gt;:</span> Weighted chart.</p>

<p class=B>The -rc composite and -rm time-space midpoint relationship charts
may be weighted to give more influence to one of the charts. When the switches
are invoked as -rc0 or -rm0 they accept two additional parameters which are the
ratio weights to give to the two chart files in question. For example, the
sequence -rm person1 person2 2 1 will still do a time space midpoint chart,
but the time and location that the chart is cast for will be biased at a 2:1
ratio toward person1, i.e. will be 2/3 of the way from person2s chart info
closer to person1s info.</p>

<p class=B>Note that the -rc0 switch can be used to generate multiple composite
charts between more than two people! A composite chart between two people can
already be done and saved to a file with -rc person1 person2 -o0 composite12.
A third person can now be merged in by doing a composite between it and the
composite of the first two, but giving the first result a 2:1 ratio because two
charts have already gone into it, by -rc0 composite12 person3 2 1 -o0
composite123. A fourth person can then be merged in at a higher ratio with -rc0
composite123 person4 3 1 -o0 composite1234 and so on. Actually this method
won't always generate a 100% correct multiple composite chart in cases where
the objects are spread out over 180 degrees and the initial composites put the
current midpoint in the wrong half, e.g. if the Suns of person1 through person3
are 1Can, 29Sag, and 0Ari, then the true composite Sun is at 0Ari, but
composite12 is at 0Lib and hence the final composite is at 0Leo or 0Sag, in the
wrong quadrant biased toward the earlier results. Still the results are
useful and the method can be used with -rm0 to get the correct average between
multiple chart locations.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-rd &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;:</span> Print time
span between files' dates.</p>

<p class=B>One useful non-astrological function in the program is the ability
to determine how much time has passed between two dates, with the -rd switch.
As with the -rb option below, this is considered a relationship chart because
it requires the input of two different dates, and when -rd is in effect, again
the standard -v planet position listing will be replaced by a line telling how
much time has passed in the interval. The time difference is expressed in seven
ways: in years, months, weeks, hours, minutes, and seconds (displayed to two
decimal places). Also, the difference in location between the two charts is
included. The degree differences between longitude and latitude are shown, as
is the actual distance between the two spots on the globe when measured around
a great circle (displayed to the degree, as well as in miles or kilometers
based on whether the European length format is active). For example, -rd
person1 person2, will display how many years, days, etc person1 is older than
person2 (or the other day around). Want to say know how many years older your
mother is than you? Just do -rd momchart yourchart. Want to find out how many
days old you will be on Jan. 1, 2020? Do -rd yourchart tty, and type in the
first date of the next decade, and see what you get!</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-rb &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;:</span> Display
biorhythm for file1 at time file2.</p>

<p class=B>Biorhythm charts are supported by Astrolog with the -rb switch.
Although not directly related to Astrology, the concepts are similar, and
adding this didn't require much extra code, and since some are interested in
this, I felt I'd add it in. The biorhythm theory says that we have three main
types of energy: Physical, Emotional, and Intellectual. These three run in continuous
wave cycles from high to low, each of which repeats about every 30 days or so.
Therefore, a biorhythm chart for a particular day should describe how much
energy one has or how they are feeling in this area. Now, Astrolog considers
biorhythm charts as a type of relationship chart, because in order to generate
one, two dates or charts are needed: the birth date of the person, and the date
to cast their chart for. Technically the program will replace the standard -v
listing of planet positions with the biorhythm chart when -rb is in effect. As
an example, -rb file1 file2 will cast the chart for the birthday signified by
chart1 or chart2 (whichever is older) for the date in the other file. Remember
that one can substitute the pseudo filename 'tty' to mean get the chart info
from the terminal instead.</p>

<p class=B>The actual biorhythm chart itself will display, for the day in
question, what the percentages of the physical, emotional, and intellectual
cycles are, as numbers from -100% (low ebb) to +100% (happy and full of
energy). In addition, the biorhythm percentages for the seven days before (T-7
days) and the seven days after (T+7 days) the date in question will be listed,
too, so one can see if the cycles are rising or falling. Finally, as a cute way
to help in interpretation, the program prints the appropriate smiley, medium,
or sad face after each percentage. (BTW, it takes over 58 years for all three
cycles together to synchronize and repeat themselves.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-r0 &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;:</span> Keep the
charts separate in comparison.</p>

<p class=B>There is a distinction between any of the above types of particular
relationship charts and the actual comparison between two separate charts. The
-r0 option is used to generate actual comparison charts. For example, combining
-r0 with the -g switch will cause a full grid chart of the aspects between all
the planets of the two charts (with person1s planets on the vertical axis and
person2s on the horizontal) to be displayed. (Note that if all 20 standard objects
are unrestricted here, the text mode grid will exceed 80 columns, unless the
-Y8 80 column clip feature is turned on.) The -r0 option can also be used with
the -X switch to generate true relationship bi-wheel charts. The -r0 option
will act like the -r synastry option for those displays which can't compare two
charts. (Note the -y file current transit option is basically a shorthand way
of doing -r0 file now.) If you want to enter relationship comparison mode
without specifying files, use the -r2 switch which takes no parameters.</p>

<p class=B>Comparison relationship charts may be generated for the standard -v
text listing. This is the text mode version of a bi, tri, or quad wheel chart,
and is displayed with the -v -r0 switch combination. The two to four charts
covered will each have of their planet positions (both zodiac position and
latitude) listed side by side. Also included is a delta, listing the distance
between each pair of planets, or the maximum distance between any two planets
in the case of tri and quad charts. This delta distance is the difference
between zodiac positions (unless the 3D aspects setting is active, in which
case it will be the great circle distance taking latitude into account too).</p>

<p class=B>Comparison relationship charts may also be generated for the -m
midpoint and -a aspect list options. Combining -m with -r0 will yield an
ordered list of all midpoints between all combinations of one planet from
chart1 and another planet from chart2. Combining -a with -r0 will yield a list
of all aspects between planets in the two charts, in order based on what
Astrolog think their influences are. So, if you really want to know if your Sun
widely trining your partners Moon, will override the effect of your Saturn
closely squaring their Mars, do astrolog -r0 yourchart theirchart -a and see
the influence given to each aspect.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-rp[0] &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;:</span> Like -r0
but do file1 progr. to file2.</p>

<p class=B>This switch is a form of the -r0 relationship comparison charts.
This switch, given two files, will compare the natal chart in file1, to the
chart of this natal chart progressed to the time specified in file2. This is a
shorthand way to the commonly desired comparison of a progressed chart to a
natal one. The -y switch may be invoked as -yp &lt;file&gt; which will
automatically compare the chart to the current time now. For example, to get a
dual graphic wheel chart with your natal planets in the inner wheel, and your
current progressed chart on the outer wheel, simply do -yp yourchart now -X.
(There is no easy way to do this otherwise, short of using -o0 position files,
since the -p progression switch will affect all charts.) The -rp switch may
also be invoked as -rp0, which will do the same thing but as a solar arc
progression instead of a secondary progression.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-rt &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;:</span> Like -r0 but
treat file2 as transiting.</p>

<p class=B>The -rt switch will behave exactly like the existing -r0 chart
comparison option but with a difference: transit restrictions will affect the
second chart. With -r0, both charts are treated as natal charts and hence the
normal -R restrictions apply to both. However, one may want to have different
sets of planets active in the two charts, such as in a wheel chart where
transiting planets are being compared to natal. Another difference with this transit
and natal comparison relationship chart is that it sets the velocity for all
natal planets to 0, so aspects show whether transits to natal planes are applying
or separating correctly.</p>

<p class=B>The -y switch which is like the -r0 switch but assumes the current
moment now for the second chart, may be done as -yt in the same way. For
example, to do a graphic bi-wheel showing your complete natal chart in the
inner wheel, and only the current transiting outer planets on the outer wheel,
do astrolog -yt yourchart -X -RT0 jup sat ura nep plu.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-r[3,4]:</span> Make graphics wheel chart tri-wheel or
quad-wheel.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can do tri-wheel and quad-wheel graphics charts. These are
like the standard and bi-wheel charts, but with a third and fourth ring of
planets. The standard or first chart in memory is placed on the outer wheel,
next in is the second chart in memory, where the third and fourth charts are on
the inside. (Note this is different from the bi-wheel graphic which has the
first chart on the inside and the second on the outside.) The house cusps and
the graphic sidebar if showing will correspond to the info in the first ring. Lines
in the middle of the chart will show aspects between planets in any two
different pairs of charts present. In other words, a bi-wheel shows aspects
between chart #1 and chart #2, and a tri-wheel shows aspects between chart #1
and #2, #1 and #3, and #2 and #3. When the -XC house details display flag is off,
the program will draw dotted lines from each planet in the outer rings to the
inner one, as is always done in the bi-wheel chart. The -r3 switch, taking no
parameters, puts one in tri-wheel mode, and the -r4 switch puts on in
quad-wheel mode. (You can also do -r2 to enter bi-wheel mode, and -r1 or _r to
return to the standard single wheel.) These charts will highlight the space
between the different planet rings with dark green circles. (This color can be
customized, or set to black to remove the highlighting altogether.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-y &lt;file&gt;:</span> Display current house transits
for particular chart.</p>

<p class=B>The command switch '-y &lt;file&gt;' can be used as a shortcut way
to compute the current transits for the chart in &lt;file&gt; (unless the TIME
features are compiled out), which saves you from having to mention the now in
the -r0 option.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-y[b,d,p,t] &lt;file&gt;:</span> Like -r0 but compare
to current time now.</p>

<p class=B>The -y option is extended based on the -rb and -rd features. The -yb
&lt;file&gt; switch will display the person indicated in files biorhythm for
today. The -yd &lt;file&gt; switch will display how many months, days, etc old
the person in the file is right now. Want to know how many minutes old you are?
Just do -yd yourchart. Do the same command again right away and see that you
are now a couple seconds older than the first time! There are also switches
-yp[0] and -yt which similarly behave like -rp[0] and -rt above but
automatically compare to now.</p>

<p class=Section2>Switches to access graphics options:</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-k:</span> Display text charts using Ansi characters
and color.</p>

<p class=B>With this option, the text charts may be displayed in color, as well
as with real graphics characters instead of using things like dashes and
pluses. This makes the text charts look almost as neat as their color graphics
counterparts. All thats needed is a terminal that accepts Ansi escape
sequences. You will get garbage if you include -k on a non-Ansi terminal. (For
this reason, the default for this flag is off for non-Windows systems, although
it can be made on all the time by setting the appropriate flag in the
astrolog.as configuration file.) Include the -k switch on the command line, and
the program will display all charts as before, but change the color appropriately
for every part of any chart printed! Just try a -w chart, a -g grid, or a -t
list and see the difference of how much easier it is to find a planet or aspect
among a large chart! I highly recommend this setting be made on by default in
the astrolog.as file if your system will support it, especially for those who
display text charts on the screen more often than they print one out.</p>

<p class=B>Color isn't used randomly but is based on logic. Most colors are
very similar to the ones chosen in the color X charts. In general, everything
is based on the following rules for elements: By default, Fire is Red, Earth is
Yellow, Air is Green, and Water is Blue. Zodiac signs and positions are printed
in the color of their element. Houses are printed in the color of their corresponding
sign. Planets are printed in the color of the sign they rule. As for the other
objects, we have the following colors: Asteroids are in bright purple
(magenta), Uranians are in dim purple, and non-physical points like the Node,
Fortune, and Vertex are in a bluish gray (dark cyan). Stars are either orange
if they are bright (magnitude &lt; 1.0) or a dark red if dimmer. For aspects we
have the following: Conjunctions are Yellow, Oppositions are Blue, Squares are
Red, Trines are Green, Sextiles are Light Blue (Cyan). For the minor aspects we
have magenta for inconjunct/semisextile, orange for
semisquare/sesquiquadrature, dark cyan for all the quintiles, dark purple for
all the septiles, and dark red for all the noviles.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-k0:</span> Like -k but only use special characters,
not Ansi color.</p>

<p class=B>This minor switch is just like the -k switch, however it only
toggles whether the high Ascii graphics characters are used, as opposed to -k
which toggles both that and whether Ansi colors are used. A system with a black
and white monitor may want to use high graphics but not color, while a system
with a foreign character set may prefer color but not graphics characters.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-kh:</span> Text charts saved to file use HTML instead
of Ansi codes.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog supports saving text charts in HTML format. This is useful
in order to transfer Astrolog text into other programs with color formatting
intact. When this setting is on, in the Windows version the Save Chart Text
Output command will produce HTML format files instead of plain text files, and
the Copy Chart Text Output command will put HTML Format content on the
Windows clipboard. Note that Web pages have a white background by default,
which means that output will appear similar to Astrolog screen text when the
reverse background setting (-Xr switch) is on. That means white text will be
black in the HTML file, and light gray text will appear dark gray and vice
versa.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-X:</span> Create a graphics chart instead of
displaying it as text.</p>

<p class=B>This is the general switch, which means display a chart in an X
window instead of on the screen in some form. For example, the command
'astrolog -i mychart -X' will open a new window and display the chart in
question in it. (Of course, all the other switches, e.g. -R, -c, -1, etc, can
be used to change what info is actually displayed.) If you use the -L
astro-graph switch in addition to this, the appropriate Astrocartography map
will come up in a window instead of the earlier boring list of longitudes.
(e.g. astrolog -i me -X -L) The -Z and -g switches will produce their own chart
types as well, although, of course, only one type of chart can be in a window
at any given time.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xb:</span> Create bitmap file instead of putting
graphics on screen.</p>

<p class=B>This switch will cause a bitmap file to be produced and written to a
file instead of putting the graphics on the actual screen. This is useful if
you want to convert the graphics to different formats, e.g. so they can be
displayed on alternate systems, etc. Note that -Xb (or any other
-X&lt;letter&gt; switch) automatically assumes the -X switch above, so
'astrolog -i file -Xb' is sufficient (and you don't also have to include the
-X).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xb[n,c,v,a,b]:</span> Set bitmap file output mode to
X11 normal, compacted, very compact, Ascii (bmtoa), or Windows bmp.</p>

<p class=B>The bitmap file can be written in five different formats; by default
whatever format specified at compile time is used. One can change this mode by
putting an extra character on the command line after the -Xb switch.
Specifically, to override the compile time mode, use -Xbn for a standard X11
bitmap, -Xbc for an X11 bitmap with some white space removed, -Xbv for a very
compact X11 bitmap (which may not be able to be processed correctly by all X
programs), -Xba for a one character per pixel Ascii dump identical to the
result generated from the X11 bmtoa program, and finally -Xbb for the Windows
.bmp bitmap described below.</p>

<p class=B>One of the available bitmap formats are the .bmp extension bitmap
files commonly used on PCs running under Microsoft Windows. If you have a PC
running Windows, you can set your root background to be one of these monochrome
Astrolog bitmaps by: use the -Xb option to create a bitmap file, then rename it
to have the extension .bmp and put it in your Windows subdirectory, then go
into Program Manager -&gt; Control Panels -&gt; Desktop and select this file to
be your wallpaper. These bitmap files may be generated in either color or
black and white. By default, all graphic charts will be in color, unless
specified otherwise. Color is most useful for these PC bitmaps (-Xbb), although
a color bitmap will take up more disk space. X11 bitmap files will always be
output in monochrome format, since color .xbm files don't exist. A color Ascii
file (-Xba) will have the color value of each pixel converted to a hexadecimal
number, instead of being in the format generated by the Unix bmtoa utility in
the case of monochrome charts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xp:</span> Create PostScript vector graphic instead
of bitmap file.<br>
<span class=S>-Xp0:</span> Like -Xp but create complete instead of encapsulated
file.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can generate PostScript graphics files. PostScript is a
graphics format different from bitmaps in that its based on vector strokes as
opposed to pixels. With a vector graphic, an image is defined in terms of circle
here, line there, etc instead of a large array. This means PostScript graphics
can be printed at any size without losing accuracy or becoming pixilated or blocky,
and look perfectly smooth when printed to a laser printer. A PostScript file is
also about an order of magnitude smaller in size than a corresponding bitmap
file.</p>

<p class=B>To generate a PostScript chart, use the -Xp switch. This will work
just like bitmap files for all Astrologs graphics charts, in that you will be
prompted for a file to write the graphics to unless you explicitly pass a file
to the -Xo switch. The type of file generated will be an encapsulated
PostScript graphic (which are usually seen with a .eps extension) meaning that
its made to be inserted into a document and scaled and so on and printed from
there. A true independent PostScript file which can be sent directly to a printer
can be generated by specifying -Xp as -Xp0 instead. As with bitmaps, it is
recommended to include -Xm for a monochrome graphic unless you have a color
printer, and to include -Xr so the chart is black on a white background (so
that you don't cover 90% of the page with ink when printing)!</p>

<p class=B>There is a compile time option #define PS in the astrolog.h which
can be commented out to disable the -Xp switch and all PostScript features.
Note that on an X window system one may directly print out a bitmap to a PostScript
printer even without this internal support. One simply brings up an Astrolog
chart in an X window, or creates a bitmap and displays that bitmap in a window
using some other graphics program, and then uses the Unix command xdpr to
print it, with a line such as xdpr -P&lt;postscriptprintername&gt; -device ps,
and then clicking on the window to print it to the specified printer. Of
course, the native PostScript charts will look much smoother.</p>

<p class=B>Special thanks to Mr. Brian D. Willoughby who wrote the routines and
parts in the file xdevice.cpp which deal with PostScript (e.g. whats the PS
command to draw a line, ellipse, filled rectangle, etc.) Basically, if its
inside #ifdef PS, Brian likely gets credit for it, and for anything else
(except the Swiss Ephemeris, Placalc, and Matrix source files) I'm the one to
blame. :)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XM[0]:</span> Create Windows metafile vector graphic
instead of bitmap.</p>

<p class=B>Another graphics format, Astrolog can generate Windows metafiles.
Metafiles are those files (usually with extension .wmf and often called pictures
for users) that are frequently used in Microsoft Windows for clipart and other
such things. (Astrolog is one of the few non-Windows programs which can
generate metafiles internally without relying on Windows itself.)</p>

<p class=B>Like PostScript, metafiles are a vector graphic format. Metafiles
are in binary format unlike the human readable Ascii text in PostScript files,
and hence are smaller in size for the same image. Although the same chart
generated in PostScript and metafile format will more or less look the same,
for PC and Windows users, metafiles are preferred. (For Unix systems PostScript
is preferred since there aren't many Unix apps out there that know or care
about Windows metafiles, while PostScript is a standard used everywhere.) A
metafile can be inserted as a picture into Word, CorelDraw, and pasted into
Windows Write and many other applications. Unlike PostScript, a metafile can be
displayed on the screen in your document, instead of like most EPS files which
when displayed by Windows just indicate that this is an PostScript image and
have to be printed to be seen. A metafile can actually be edited in MS Draw and
many other drawing applications where one may modify the Astrolog chart, change
colors, add text, and so on before printing!</p>

<p class=B>Metafiles (and PostScript graphics) have the option to use system
fonts for text, as well as zodiac signs, planets, and aspect glyphs. This will
look smoother than having Astrolog draw all characters with 45 degree line
segments. There is a setting in the astrolog.as file which when set by the user
will always use system fonts instead of simulating them. If the -XM switch is
invoked as -XM0 instead, the status of this flag will be toggled for the chart
generated. (This switch can be used with PostScript charts by specifying -XM0
-Xp.) In the PostScript charts, the following printer fonts are used: Courier
for text, Times Roman for house labels, and Astro for sign, planet, and aspect
glyphs.</p>

<p class=B>For these metafiles, the following Windows TrueType fonts are used:
Courier-New for text, Times New Roman for house labels, Wingdings for sign
glyphs, and Astro for planets and aspect glyphs. All of these fonts should be
installed on your system already except likely Astro. This font, created by
Kenneth Hirst, is available at <a href="http://www.ffonts.net/Astro.font">http://www.ffonts.net/Astro.font</a>.
To install it on Windows, unzip this file, then go into the Windows Control
Panel and select the Fonts icon. Click on the Add button and select the file astro.ttf
that was in the zip archive, and the font will be installed on your system. If
its not installed, the planet and aspect glyphs will appear as letters. (Note:
If you can't get access to the Astro font, but still want all the other fonts
to be included, then change the value of the -YXf font selection setting so
none of its digits are 2, which will cause only the planet and aspect glyphs to
be simulated by Astrolog.)</p>

<p class=B>It is possible that a metafile using all the system fonts may print
perfectly to a PostScript printer, but a PS file itself won't find the Astro
font. This is because the Astro font may be installed on your Windows system,
but not on the printer itself, and because when printing a metafile to a
printer, Windows will conveniently automatically embed the necessary font
information in what it sends to the printer if the font isn't already there.
Note that one may actually generate a PostScript chart from a metafile in
Windows by using the Print Manager (or the Setup dialog button available from
within those Windows host applications that use the standard Print dialog) to
set printing to be to an encapsulated PS file instead of directly to a printer.
Of course doing this won't likely be needed since Astrolog can generate PS
files natively.</p>

<p class=B>Like bitmaps, creating metafiles is also efficient in how it uses
memory. Astrolog will attempt to allocate a large buffer for them, and keep
decreasing the amount until it succeeds. (Note that the related PostScript
charts don't need any memory buffers because theyre written to disk while
being generated.) There is a compile time option #define META in the astrolog.h
which can be commented out to disable the -XM switch and all metafile features.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-X3:</span> Create Daedalus wireframe vector file
instead of bitmap.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog supports saving graphics charts in 3D wireframe format.
These wireframe files are a vector format similar to the PostScript and Windows
metafile formats, except theyre true 3D models formed of line segments with
separate X, Y, and Z coordinates. Such wireframe files can be viewed from
different angles, rendered in perspective, and even explored from inside. With
the right software and hardware, one could potentially use a 3D printer with an
Astrolog wireframe, and have a physical 3D model of your chart! :)</p>

<p class=B>Most charts in wireframe mode are just lines drawn within a 2D
plane, however some Astrolog charts have special wireframe versions of them
that are fully 3D. The chart sphere and the globe charts are self-explanatory
in wireframe mode since theyre already 3D models. The solar system orbit chart
plots the planets in 3D space, in which the inclinations of the orbits above or
below the ecliptic can be seen. In all wireframe charts, planet glyphs are in
the horizontal plane (so theyre best seen looked down on from above) and the
points where planets actually are located are marked with small wireframe
diamonds.</p>

<p class=B>More specifically, Astrolog produces wireframe files in the Daedalus
wireframe format. That is a plain text file format listing the numeric coordinates
of each line segment, which is simple enough to be edited by hand or converted
to other 3D formats. The easiest way to view and work with Daedalus wireframe
files is by loading them into Daedalus, a graphics program by the same author.
See <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm">http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm</a>
for more about the program Daedalus. Note that Daedalus versions 3.2 and before
only support monochrome wireframes, so Astrolog needs to be in monochrome mode
(-Xm switch off) in order for older versions of Daedalus to be able to properly
parse the Astrolog generated wireframe file. For an example of Astrolog
generated wireframe files rendered in Daedalus, see this video: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdRaDGXBV-0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdRaDGXBV-0</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xo &lt;file&gt;:</span> Write output bitmap or
graphic to specified file.</p>

<p class=B>This switch is used in conjunction with the -Xb, -Xp, or -XM
options, to specify the name of the file to write the graphic image to. If not
included the program will prompt you for the filename before writing to disk.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XB:</span> Display X chart on root instead of in a
separate window.</p>

<p class=B>For X window systems only, this switch will cause the chart graphics
to be displayed directly on the root window. This action occurs very quickly
since the program does not have to write a separate bitmap file and call
xsetroot -bitmap on it (although one could easily do this if they want to). For
example, one could put the line 'astrolog -n -XB' in their .xsession file and
whenever they log in, their background will be set to a chart of the current
state of the planets!</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xm:</span> Create monochrome graphic instead of one
in color.</p>

<p class=B>For systems without color monitors, the -Xm switch will create all
charts in monochrome B/W mode. One can still generate color bitmap files on a
monochrome system, just can't properly display them of course.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xr:</span> Create chart graphic in reversed colors
(white background).</p>

<p class=B>Normally the charts comes up white on a black background. To get the
chart or bitmap displayed in reverse video (black on white), use this -Xr
switch.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xw &lt;hor&gt; [&lt;ver&gt;], -ge[..]:</span> Change
the size of chart graphic.</p>

<p class=B>The default graphic chart size is 600x600 pixels. This can be
changed with the -Xw switch. Passing -Xw with one argument n will make an n by
n pixel chart. Passing -Xw with two arguments x and y will make an x by y
image. If -Xw is passed zero, then it will use the compile time default window
size. Note that this switch will not affect astro-graph or aspect grid windows.
To change the size of those charts use -Xs below.</p>

<p class=B>For X window systems only, Astrolog accepts the standard -geometry
switch (which can be abbreviated as -geom or anything starting with -ge). This
is only an alias to this -Xw chart size switch, in that it takes the same
parameters in the same way.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xs &lt;100,200,300,400&gt;:</span> Change the size of
map or characters by %.</p>

<p class=B>Note that the size of the planet and sign glyphs don't change when
you change the size of a graphics chart. This can cause problems for very small
charts where the glyphs overlap the rest of the chart and for very large charts
where there is lots of excess space. The -Xs switch can be used to change the
size of all glyphs. The valid values that can be passed to it are 100, 200,
300, and 400 where 200 is the default. Note that this switch is used to change
the size of the astro-graph (and aspect grid) graphic charts (because the world
map is sort of considered to be one giant glyph by the program.)</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog has its own internal character set definitions for the
glyphs which it just draws at a higher scale based on the -Xs setting. This can
make glyphs at higher scales look slightly blocky. To help prevent this, theres
a second alternate internal font of double sized glyphs for planets, signs,
aspects, and house numbers, which allow the 100% or small scale, and the 200%
or medium scale glyphs, to appear smooth to the nearest pixel. (These improved
larger glyphs are also used at the 400% or huge scale, and when printing.)
Theres also a set of triple sized sign and house number glyphs used at the
300% or large character scale.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XS &lt;100,200,300,400&gt;:</span> Change size of
graphics chart text by %.</p>

<p class=B>The size for text within graphics charts (such as the text in the
wheel chart sidebar, and the text at the bottom of the screen in other charts)
can be changed with this switch. The valid values that can be passed to it are
100, 200, 300, and 400 where 100 is the default. On high resolution monitors
with many pixels, the default text size may be small enough to be hard to read,
so increasing it may be appropriate.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XQ:</span> Ensure square charts remain so regardless
of bitmap size.</p>

<p class=B>This setting will force all graphics charts to be square, assuming
they can be resized arbitrarily and look better when square. This option is
similar to running the Graphics / Square Screen menu command in the Windows
version after every manual window resize (except it wont automatically resize
the window to fit the final chart size, but rather will draw within the largest
square area within the window). If this option is not on, then resizing a wheel
chart will result in an elliptical wheel.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xi:</span> Create chart graphic in slightly modified
form.</p>

<p class=B>The display of graphics charts can be modified in various minor
ways, such as adding or removing certain information. Rather than add a new
hard to remember minor option for each charts change, there is one comprehensive
switch which covers all charts. The -Xi switch will invoke this induce/inhibit
information option, and pressing the 'i' key in a window will accomplish the
same thing by toggling the modes status. When this option is set, it affects
each graphic chart in a different way, as follows:</p>

<p class=B>For the standard -v and relationship -r0 -v wheel charts, and the -l
sector chart, it will toggle the dashedness of the aspect lines in the middle
of the wheel (i.e. it negates the value of the -YXa switch).</p>

<p class=B>For the -g aspect grid, it will flip the aspects and midpoints
across the center diagonal, i.e. the midpoints will be below it and the aspects
above it, instead of the other way around. For the -r0 -g relationship aspect
grid, the entire grid will be replaced with one showing all midpoints between
all the objects in the two charts. Note: The -g0 switch when combined with -r0
will also generate a relationship midpoint (as opposed to aspect with just -g)
grid. However, this will revert back to the aspect grid if both -Xi and -g0 are
in effect with -r0.)</p>

<p class=B>For the -Z horizon chart and -S space chart, it will, for the major
planets, increase the size of the points showing where each object actually
is, making a brighter spot, for easier viewing; combine this in the horizon
chart with the 'l' key label inhibitor and get a very realistic view of the
night sky, with planets brighter and all.</p>

<p class=B>For the -K calendar chart, it will display the numbers for dates in
the middle of their squares instead of in the upper left corner.</p>

<p class=B>For the -j dispositor chart, it will avoid circling planets which
are final dispositors.</p>

<p class=B>For the -7 esoteric Ray chart, it will compute Ray powers based on
their slice proportions instead of their count of times present.</p>

<p class=B>For the -L astro-graph chart, this will eliminate the display of the
Ascendant, Descendant, and Nadir lines, leaving just the vertical Midheaven
lines and zenith points, for an increase in speed and much less clutter when
including many objects.</p>

<p class=B>For the -E graphical ephemeris chart, it will exclude showing the
Moon and Part of Fortune without having to restrict them, which is commonly
desired because their lines move across the ephemeris chart much faster than
any of the other objects.</p>

<p class=B>For the -B and -V transit graphs, it will draw a dark green vertical
line highlighting the current charts time and date.</p>

<p class=B>For the -XX chart sphere display, it will show only one side of the
sphere, making it appear as if youre inside it.</p>

<p class=B>For the -XW world map display, -XG globe display, and -XP polar
globe display, it will make them show just the world map or globe itself, and
not display the zenith locations of the charts planets or any astro-graph
lines.</p>

<p class=C>Note there is a special case situation that can arise with the -XW,
-XG, and -XP switches: These displays can be brought up in a window without
having to specify any chart data. Now suppose one presses 'V', 'L', etc. to
bring up a chart, then what will be displayed? The answer will be whatever
initial values were already there, and if youre curious, its set to be my own
birth data: 11:01am PST (8 hours before UTC) on Friday, November 19, 1971 in
Seattle, WA (122W19:59 47N36:35). This info can also be brought up by accessing
the -i nul virtual chart straight from the command line before any other
switches.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xt:</span> Inhibit display of chart info at bottom of
graphic.</p>

<p class=B>Normally, at the bottom of any chart graphic is printed some header
information listing the name, date, time, and location of the chart in question
(unless the info is already being shown in a sidebar). One can inhibit this
display by specifying the -Xt switch.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xu:</span> Inhibit display of a border around
graphic.</p>

<p class=B>This switch toggles off the border setting, which is also
interactively toggled by pressing the 'b' key when a graphics screen is up. This
covers the rectangular border around the outside of most charts, as well as the
circular border around globes and the elliptical border around the Mollewide
projection of the world map. This switch allows one to toggle the border for
graphics files, as well as set the default for this in the astrolog.as file.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xl:</span> Inhibit labeling of object points in chart
graphic.</p>

<p class=B>This switch will inhibit labeling with glyphs or text abbreviations,
the spots indicating the positions of planets in the various graphics charts.
This is just the command line counterpart to the existing functionality
accessed by the 'l' key.</p>

<p class=N><span class=S>-XA:</span> Draw aspect glyphs over aspect lines in
charts.</p>

<p class=B>Lines indicating aspects between objects (such as seen in the middle
of wheel charts, as well as in solar system orbit charts and chart spheres)
have the option to draw the aspects glyph over the middle of the line. This
switch (and the Show Glyphs On Aspect Lines menu command on the Graphics /
Map Effects submenu) will label aspect lines in this manner.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xj:</span> Don't clear screen between chart updates,
drawing trails.</p>

<p class=B>This switch will toggle on a flag which will cause the graphics
screen to not be cleared on new chart draws. Pressing the 'j' key interactively
will toggle the same setting. This feature is used to draw jet trail streaks
on the screen for some charts, such as the -S orbit and -Z local horizon. If
you bring up one of these charts, turn on the setting, and then animate
forward, a time exposure can be done showing the orbits of planets or an
objects path across the sky.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xe:</span> Draw Earth's equator in certain charts.</p>

<p class=B>This switch causes Earths equator to be displayed in graphics
charts. The equator can be displayed in the graphic local horizon chart, along
with in the chart sphere, world map, and globe displays. Note that in local
horizon charts and chart spheres, the equator line always passes through the
East and West points (i.e. where the prime vertical intersects the horizon).</p>

<p class=B>The equator setting will also toggle display effects in other charts:
In graphic wheel charts, whether aspect lines are shown in the middle of the
wheel is toggled with this setting. In the -S solar system chart, whether
aspect lines are drawn between planets is toggled with this setting.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XU:</span> Draw all stars from sefstars.txt file in
certain charts.                                                                                  </p>

<p class=B>Astrolog supports displaying thousands of stars in its graphics
charts. These extra stars will appear in the chart sphere, graphic local
horizon chart, and constellation map charts. Unlike the actual 47 fixed star
objects that Astrolog has supported for many versions, these extra stars dont
have object indexes, arent labeled by default, and cant be individually
restricted with the -R switch. In the Windows version and when saved to
wireframe files they will be colored different shades of gray according to
their brightness in the night sky. In contexts with a limited color palette
these extra stars will be either dark gray, light gray, or white depending on
their brightness. These stars are the complete set of stars from the Swiss
Ephemeris file sefstars.txt that comes with Astrolog. Altogether there are 1100
stars total by default, and when displayed they allow one to see constellations
in the sky such as the Big Dipper.</p>

<p class=B>The list of additional stars will only include physical stars and
skip virtual bodies such as the galactic pole, if the Graphs Include All
Planets setting is off (-B0/V0 switches). This will reduce the number of stars
in the additional stars list from 1111 to 1100. Non-star points like this are
apparent in the sefstars.txt star list file because they have non-standard
magnitudes like 0.0 or 999.99.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XU[0-3]:</span> Like -XU but set whether to show
larger star dot and name.</p>

<p class=B>The list of additional stars can have the stars displayed as larger
dots, and can also have the stars labeled with their names. Stars will be
labeled with their traditional or common name (if any), otherwise by their
scientific nomenclature abbreviation. The -XU switch can be invoked as -XU1 to
turn on larger dot placement, -XU2 to turn on name labeling, -XU3 to do both,
and -XU0 to do neither.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XE &lt;low&gt; &lt;high&gt;:</span> Draw range of
asteroids in certain charts.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can display custom asteroids and other bodies, assuming
their Swiss Ephemeris format ephemeris files have been downloaded, however
doing so usually requires specifying each asteroid individually. The -XE switch
will display an arbitrarily long sequence of asteroids. It takes two
parameters: The low and high minor planet numbers of the bodies to calculate
and list. This is a quick way to display hundreds or even thousands of
asteroids at once, assuming their ephemeris files have been downloaded. Extra
asteroids may be seen in the graphics charts for local horizon (-Z switch),
solar system orbit (-S switch), on world maps and chart spheres, and in the
text mode list objects table (-HO switch). For example, heres a fun Astrolog
animation in which 10,000 asteroids are orbiting around the Sun at once: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/asteroid.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/asteroid.gif</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XE[0-3] [..]:</span> Like _XE but set whether to
label ast number and name.</p>

<p class=B>The asteroid list feature is very similar to the -XU switch which
displays all the stars in the sefstars.txt file, except this displays a range
of asteroids instead. The -XU switch subsetting will affect asteroids too, in
which -XU1 shows just a dot, -XU2 has the asteroids name labeled, -XU3 is a
larger dot, and -XU4 is a large dot with label. Assuming labels are present as
defined by -XU, then the -XE switch can be invoked with a trailing digit to
determine how exactly asteroids are labeled. Doing -XE1 will have no label,
-XE2 will label with the asteroids number (e.g. 10), -XE3 will label with
the asteroids name (e.g. Hygiea), and -XE4 will label with both number and
name (e.g. 10 Hygiea).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XL:</span> Plot city locations from atlas on world
map.</p>

<p class=B>Astrologs atlas is graphical! :) It can plot the location of all
cities in its atlas on the graphic world map and globe displays. To show them,
turn on this switch (which is also available as the Show Cities menu command
on the Graphics / Map Effects submenu).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XL[1-5]:</span> Like _XL but set how to color cities
(when -XA is on).</p>

<p class=B>Normally all cities are displayed in the same color. However, if the
aspect line labeling setting (-XA switch) is also on, then cities will be
colored differently. If the -XL switch is invoked with a trailing digit, it
will affect how cities are colored:</p>

<p class=B>-XL1: Cities are colored one of the seven colors of the rainbow
based on their country.<br>
-XL2: Like -XL1 but USA states and Canada provinces are also colored
differently.<br>
-XL3: Cities are colored one of six colors of the rainbow based on their
default time zone offset in effect today. Cities on non-hour time zones (such
as India) are colored magenta instead.<br>
-XL4: Like -XL3 but the correct offset (including Daylight Time) is calculated
for each city based on the current chart time. For past times before a location
started using time zones, cities are colored gray instead. This Astrolog
animation shows how time zones have changed and been introduced over 180 years:
<a href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/timezone.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/timezone.gif</a><br>
-XL5: Color each city an individual color, in one of seven colors of the
rainbow.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XC:</span> Draw house boundaries or alternate info in
certain charts.</p>

<p class=B>This switch controls whether house boundaries are displayed in
graphics charts, or it toggles the display of various details related to
houses. This setting affects different graphics charts in different ways:</p>

<p class=B>Local horizon and chart spheres: Whether house boundaries are drawn.
Note these can be either 3D or 2D house boundaries, depending on whether the 3D
houses setting is active (-c3 switch).<br>
Solar system orbit: Whether sign boundaries are drawn.<br>
Maps and globes: Whether sign boundaries and the ecliptic are drawn.<br>
Dispositor chart: Whether the depositor wheels have the Sun or first object at
the top of the wheel instead of at the left.<br>
Wheel charts: Whether a dotted line is drawn from planets in outer wheels to
the innermost wheel. Even for the common single wheel chart this setting has a
minor effect, and determines whether the dots for each planet are larger.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-X1 &lt;object&gt;:</span> Rotate wheel charts so
object is at left edge.</p>

<p class=B>Another graphics feature, this allows one to effectively rotate one
of the graphic wheel charts so that a particular object is hinged to the left
hand (east) edge of the chart. Given the -X1 switch with the index value of an
object, the wheel is drawn but always rotated so that the object in question is
at the left side of the chart. By default we have the ascendant at the left
edge, of course. This is useful for tracking important planets so one knows
where they are, but yet doesn't distort the house cusps as the -1 switch does.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-X2 &lt;object&gt;:</span> Rotate wheel charts so
object is at top edge.</p>

<p class=B>This is identical to the -X1 switch above except here we rotate the
entire graphic wheel so the object in question is always at the top of the
chart. Note that during a day, the degree difference between the Ascendant and
Midheaven varies in most house systems, so that with the Ascendant hinged at
the left edge, the Midheaven will wobble back and forth near the top of the
wheel. If you prefer, -X2 Mid will fix the Midheaven at the top of the
screen, and the chart will be like before except the Ascendant will be the one
to wobble near the left edge of the chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xd &lt;name&gt;, -di[..] &lt;name&gt;:</span> Open X
window on specified display.</p>

<p class=B>For X windows only, the -Xd &lt;display&gt; switch can be used to
change the display to bring the window up on. Normally, the X window will
always come up on the current display, but we can do things like astrolog -Xd
machine:0.0 and have the window appear there. In addition, the program will
accept this string through the standard -display switch common to most X11
applications (which can be abbreviated as -disp or anything starting with
-di).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XX[0] [&lt;degrees&gt; [&lt;degrees&gt;]]:</span>
Display chart sphere instead of wheel.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog supports chart spheres, which are like standard chart
wheels but in 3D. Chart spheres make it easy to see the ecliptic latitude of
planets in addition to their zodiac longitude. They are most similar to the -Z
switch graphic local horizon charts, except instead of being a flat rectangular
map, the celestial sphere is rendered like a globe.</p>

<p class=B>In a chart sphere, its equator marks the plane of the local horizon.
Lines are drawn from the center in the four directions, which are labeled
around the horizon. Between the zenith point straight up, and the nadir point
straight down, can be seen the prime vertical running through the east and west
points on the horizon, and the meridian running through the north and south
points on the horizon. In addition, the ecliptic and the 12 zodiac sign wedges
are displayed. Display of signs can be toggled with the Vedic format flag (-J
switch, or the Setting / House Settings / Vedic Wheel Display command, or with
the z key). Note that each of the four lines from the center of the sphere to
the North/South/West/East points on the horizon will only be displayed if the
corresponding Nadir/Zenith/Setting/Rising flag from rising and setting restrictions
(-YRZ switch) is off. If all four are restricted, then the prime vertical line
across the sphere will go away too. If all four are restricted and the Show House
Details setting (-XC switch) is off as well, then the horizon and meridian
lines will go away too, leaving just the lines of the ecliptic marking the
signs of the zodiac. (This last scenario goes well with turning on the -YXe switch
Use Ecliptic Axis setting, to align the sphere with the ecliptic.)</p>

<p class=B>Also in a chart sphere, the 3D boundaries of the 12 houses can be
seen, in which houses 1-6 are below the horizon and houses 7-12 are above, and
in which houses 1-3 and 10-12 are east of the meridian and houses 4-9 are west
of the meridian. Display of the houses can be toggled with the show house
details setting (-XC switch, or the Graphics / Map Effects / Show House Details
command, or with the d key). These houses will show either 3D house
boundaries or classic 2D house boundaries, based on the 3D houses flag (-c3
switch, or the Setting / House Settings / 3D Houses command, or with the a
key). Finally, the astronomical constellations will be displayed upon the
surface of the sphere if the Show Constellations setting is on (-XF switch, or
with the Graphics / Map Effects / Show Constellations command, or with the F
key).</p>

<p class=B>Planets will be plotted on the surface of the sphere based on their
zodiac position and latitude locations. Most planets will be on or near the
ecliptic, except for Pluto, asteroids, and especially fixed stars. Aspect lines
will be drawn through the middle of the sphere. If aspect lines make the
display too cluttered, the orbs can be reduced or aspects turned off
altogether. When Astrolog is showing two, three, or four charts at once, then
the chart sphere will overlay all sets of planets upon the sphere, instead of
just showing the first set of planets. This result will be a bi-sphere, which
is like a bi-wheel but for a 3D chart sphere instead of just a 2D wheel chart.</p>

<p class=B>The sphere overlaps its near and far sides, with the far side
solid, and the near side semitransparent in which planets and such are rendered
in gray. This simulates the viewer being inside the sphere, focusing upon what
is in distance, such as a person looking south toward the ecliptic assuming a
northern hemisphere chart location. If the -XX switch is invoked as -XX0
instead, the transparency will be reversed and the near side will be solid and
the far side semitransparent, as if one were outside the sphere looking upon
its surface. In the Windows version, the Globe Halves Focus On Southern
Hemisphere flag in the Graphics Settings dialog controls this, and can be
toggled with the Graphics / Modify Chart command. If you dont want any overlap
at all, turn on the modify display flag (with the -Xi switch, or the Graphics /
Modify Display menu command) and only the solid half of the sphere will be
drawn.</p>

<p class=B>Similar to Astrologs -XG switch globe display, the chart sphere can
be rotated and tilted. Two optional parameters to the -XX switch indicate how
much the sphere should be rotated around its axis, and how much it should be
tilted toward or away from the viewer. While a window is up, the sphere can be
rotated left and right with the { and } keys (or the Graphics / Map
Orientation / Rotate West and Rotate East menu commands), and can be tilted
with the [ and ] keys (the Graphics / Map Orientation / Tilt North and Tilt
South commands). Rotating and tilting is a good way to better visualize the
sphere and its contents.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XW:</span> Simply display an image of the world map.</p>

<p class=B>The world map used by the astro-graph chart is something I
painstakingly entered the data for by hand using an atlas during a long week. This
rectangular world map (-XW switch) is very similar to Astrologs existing
graphic astro-graph chart (-L -X switches), except for differences in how the
lines are labeled. (Users may prefer one style to the other.) You can switch
between the two styles of rectangular astro-graph chart with the L (for
classic astro-graph chart) and W (for world map showing astro-graph lines)
hotkeys. If you just want to see the map of the world by itself without any
astro-graph lines on it, also include the -Xi switch.</p>

<p class=B>If the 3D houses setting is active (-c3 switch), then overlaying the
world map will be shown the Earths ley line locations. Ley lines are spiritual
lines of energy crossing the Earth. I was experimenting with the master ley
line grids on the Earth (in the pattern of an overlapped 20 sided Icosahedron
and 12 sided Dodecahedron) and I figured Astrolog with its world map would be
an interesting program to explore them with. This belongs more to the field of
dowsing than to astrology, but I figured I would make it available for
amusement and inspiration.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XW0:</span> Like -XW but do a non-rectangular
Mollewide projection.</p>

<p class=B>The -XW0 switch is just like the normal -XW switch in that it just
displays the world map and nothing else, except that this -XW0 map generated
will be in whats called the Mollewide projection, a good looking form often
used for maps of the world, as opposed to the standard rectangular map
projection used in -XW which distorts the polar regions of the globe across the
top and bottom of the screen. (The Mollewide projection pinches the polar
regions together, generating a elliptical map, which is similar to the -XG globe
displays, but which shows the whole world instead of just half.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XG[0] [&lt;degrees&gt; [&lt;degrees&gt;]]:</span>
Display image of world as a globe.</p>

<p class=B>Given the data for the map of the world, there are several nice
things we can do with it. For instance, with a little trigonometry and
clipping, we can draw a globe, which is what the -XG switch does. An optional
argument will specify a rotation value in degrees to display different parts of
the globe. This graphic globe can be displayed semitransparently, with the
continents or constellations on the back side of the globe drawn in a dotted
fashion. Select this option with the -XG0 subswitch, or by turning on Globe
Halves Focus On Southern Hemisphere in Graphics Settings. In the Windows
version, this can be toggled with the Graphics / Modify Chart command.</p>

<p class=B>Note that the -XW and -XW0 maps can be animated like this -XG globe
display can. By default animation of these maps are done by shifting the whole
map to one side or the other, and wont update the underlying chart data. Because
the -XW world map and -XP polar globe displays can be animated just as the -XG
general globe display can, the -XW and -XP switches accept optional parameters
on the command line that will specify what degree (from 0 to 359) to start the
map at, just like the -XG switch does. In addition, the -XG option itself
accepts a second optional parameter, which is the starting angle for the
globes tilt, from -90 to +90 degrees.</p>

<p class=B>This globe is a 3D graphic astro-graph chart, which is drawn on a
spherical globe instead of just a flat rectangular map. This globe can be
rotated and animated, and in the Windows version you can right click and drag
to view different parts of the world. This 3D astro-graph is a separate chart
from Astrologs existing classic astro-graph chart (-L -X switches). You can
even toggle between them with the 3D Houses setting (-c3 switch or a
hotkey). An animation of this chart can be seen at: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/astgraph.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/astgraph.gif</a></p>

<p class=C>As with the classic 2D astro-graph chart, by default Midheaven lines
are yellow, Ascendant lines are red, Descendant lines are green, and Nadir
lines are blue. The Midheaven lines will be labeled at the planets zenith
point, Nadir lines at the planets nadir point, and Ascendant and Descendant
lines at Earths equator. Midheaven and Ascendant lines have glyphs in the
planets color, while Descendant and Nadir lines always have glyphs in gray.
The presence of Midheaven, Ascendant, Descendant, and Nadir lines can each be individually
toggled with the Rising and Setting Restrictions in Display Settings (-YRZ
switch). If all four are restricted, then planets will still be plotted at
their zenith points, i.e. where on the Earth each planet could be viewed by
looking straight up. A magenta dot will be drawn at the location for the chart,
with a dotted line around that latitude in order to make latitude crossings
near the location more apparent. This dot can be turned off by toggling the
Text Astro-Graph Shows Latitude Crossings flag in Chart Settings (-L0
switch).</p>

<p class=C>These 3D astro-graph displays will show astro-graph lines for the
minor cusps as well, when the minor cusp objects are unrestricted. Just as the
Ascendant line in astrocartography shows where on the world an object is
rising, a minor cusp line shows where on the world the object is exactly
conjunct that cusp (or its 3D cusp to be precise). Standard astro-graph lines
are based on the angles, and that means non-quadrant house systems (which
disassociate the 1st cusp from the Ascendant and/or the 10th cusp from the
Midheaven) will show 13 or 14 lines on the world instead of just 12. Note that
this addition is only for the world map and globe displays which can show
astro-graph lines, while the actual astro-graph chart (-L switch) is still
limited to the classic view of the angles.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XP[0] [&lt;degrees&gt;]:</span> Like -XG but create
globe from polar projection.</p>

<p class=B>The -XP option will generate a polar view map of the Earth. This is similar
to the -XG globe option except that the view is always with the north pole in
the middle, and the opposite pole around the outer edge. By default, the view
is looking down on the north pole with 0 deg W/E toward the bottom of the
screen. (Animation mode will cause the view to spin about the center of the
screen.) To see a view centered on the south pole, invoke this switch as -XP0
instead. Again, like with all the other windowed display modes, one can enter
this display with a keystroke: press 'P' in any Astrolog window and it will change
to this display.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XZ:</span> Display telescope chart zoomed in on part
of sky.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog features a new chart which shows a particular section of
sky, like what a telescope presents. Its similar to the local horizon chart,
except zoomed in and with more detail. It shows planet disk sizes of the Sun
and Moon (and planets if you zoom in enough). This is a great way to watch
solar or lunar eclipses, or transits and occultations of other bodies. (For
accurate solar eclipse viewing, have topocentric positions turned on to take
into account where you are on the globe.) If the Earth is unrestricted in a
geocentric chart, then the Earth will be drawn as its umbra and penumbra
shadows at the Moons distance, for lunar eclipses. This chart also shows Moon
phases, which means part of the Moon will be in shadow, and the phase
percentage will be displayed at the bottom of the chart. Phases can be seen on
other planets too (Mercury and Venus especially, along with outer planets
although theyre always close to full). Show the telescope with this command
switch, or the Graphics / Draw Telescope command in the Windows version.</p>

<p class=B>In the Windows version, right clicking on the chart will bring up a
context menu with a dozen commands, allowing one to toggle different settings
which determine what things are shown in the chart. As with the local horizon
chart (which shows the entire sky) the telescope chart allows you to toggle
whether constellation boundaries, zodiac sign boundaries, 2D or 3D house
boundaries, and the list of all stars are visible. In addition, one can toggle
whether the Moon and other planets are drawn as crescents (in which the part in
shadow will be drawn in dark blue) with the -XA switch setting, whether the
boundaries of planets will always be visible (even when occulted or behind
another planet) with the -L0 switch setting, whether the horizon line is drawn
(with the -Xe switch setting), and whether a grid of dots covers the chart
(with the -XL switch setting). The chart itself can reflect the local horizon
(with axes of azimuth and altitude), or the ecliptic (with axes of zodiac
position longitude and ecliptic latitude), determined with the -YXe switch
setting.</p>

<p class=B>The telescope can track a planet as it moves. An optional argument
to the -XZ switch specifies the planet to keep in the middle of the chart. In
the Windows version, the field Telescope Focuses on This Object in the
Graphics Settings dialog controls this. If a planet is not being tracked, then
the section of sky being looked upon is determined by the map rotation and tilt
settings. Changing these settings will move the chart view to other areas of
the sky, and stop any tracking that is in place. The viewing location can also
be changed by pressing the square and curly bracket hotkeys, or in the Windows
version by right clicking on the window and dragging.</p>

<p class=B>The number of degrees of sky thats visible is determined by the
-YXS switch setting. In the Windows version, the Graphics / Map Orientation /
Zoom Out and Zoom In commands will double or halve the number of degrees
seen. These commands also zoom on other graphics charts, such as the solar
system orbit and nearby cities charts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XF:</span> Display maps as constellations on the
celestial sphere.</p>

<p class=B>A graphics chart showing all 88 of the astronomical constellations
is available with the -XF switch. When this mode is active, the -XW world map
and -XG and -XP globe chart modes will draw the outlines of the constellations
on the celestial sphere instead of continents on the Earth. This mode will also
draw constellations on the -XX chart sphere, -XZ telescope, and -Z -X local
horizon chart views. Pressing the 'F' key when a graphics screen is up will
toggle this setting on. (If you aren't already in one of the map graphics
modes, -XF and the 'F' key will switch to one.) The constellation maps may be
rotated, tilted, and animated and can do everything else just like the world
maps, and depict the sky as if you were looking up at it from Earth. In the -Xi
display modification mode, the locations of the planets in the current chart
will be shown among the constellations. The constellations are labeled with
their correct abbreviations, and you can see the familiar image outlines such
as the Great Bear, Cygnus, and all the others, as well as the constellations
named after the twelve signs of the zodiac, and how these astrological signs
compare with their corresponding constellations. I happen to have four planets
in my own natal chart in the constellation Ophiuchus, while there are several
other constellations very close to the ecliptic which planets (other than the
Sun) sometimes enter, e.g. in my own chart my Pluto is in the constellation Coma
Berenices (Berenice's Hair). As with Astrologs map of the world, I entered the
data describing the irregular shape of each constellation myself, and the
boundaries are accurate although rounded to the nearest degree. This is a
unique feature that isn't in many astronomical programs much less astrological!
For a demo of this, do astrolog -i yourchartfile -XF -XG -Xn -XU and see a
rotating celestial sphere of the constellations and stars, and where the
planets in your natal chart are located within them.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Xn [&lt;mode&gt;]:</span> Start up chart or globe
display in animation mode.</p>

<p class=B>The -Xn [&lt;value&gt;] option can be used to start up an X window
in animation mode. It a window, one would have to explicitly press 'N' or a
shift+number key to start the window animation. Without a parameter after -Xn,
the option will start it up in continuous update to now mode (which is like
pressing 'N' in that any chart will be erased with the current chart now.) The
switch can accept parameters from 1..9, corresponding to the animation rates
obtained by pressing shift 1..9 in the window, i.e. update whatever chart is
passed to it seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, etc. later each
time.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XN:</span> Map animates chart time instead of
rotating map itself.</p>

<p class=B>This flag controls whether animating a map display (such as a globe,
map, or chart sphere) will animate the orientation of the map itself or the
time of the chart within the map. By default map displays animate the map
orientation, however this option allows one to animate the chart within the
map.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-XM[2-4][0] &lt;strings&gt;:</span> Define macro(s) to
run when chart drawn.</p>

<p class=B>The -XM2, -XM3, and -XM4 switches allow different graphics to be
used for different rings in a bi-wheel, tri-wheel, or quad-wheel chart. The
switches take 2, 3, or 4 string parameters respectively, and each string is a
command line that gets automatically applied before drawing that ring. For example,
you can do things such as have rings with different glyphs, different character
scales, or different restrictions.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-HX:</span> Display list of key press options for
screen graphics.</p>

<p class=B>This switch prints out the list of keys one can press when a
graphics screen is being displayed. This list may also be obtained by pressing
the '?' key interactively when graphics are actually up. With -HX, this may be
done anytime and be printed out or sent to a file like all other Astrolog
tables.</p>

<p class=Section2>Switches to access Windows options:</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-W &lt;value&gt;:</span> Run given Windows menu
command internally.</p>

<p class=B>For the Windows version only, this obscure switch allows one to
invoke a menu command from a command line, taking one numeric parameter
indicating the item to run. Values 40001 through 40270 are valid menu commands,
where the list of what number corresponds to what command is in the resource.h
source file. An example use of this is to put -W 40042 in your astrolog.as
file which will start the program with the Chart Resizes Window setting on by
default. Another example is having -W 40241 on the command line of the
programs icon to have the Chart Info dialog come up on startup.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-WN &lt;1-32000&gt;:</span> Set animation update delay
in milliseconds.</p>

<p class=B>For the Windows version only, this switch specifies the animation
delay, taking one parameter indicating the number of milliseconds between the
start of screen updates. This is the same as the animation delay edit control
in the Graphics Settings dialog, and exists here as a switch so one may set a
default value for it in the astrolog.as file.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-WM &lt;1-48&gt; &lt;text&gt;:</span> Set Windows menu
text for macro command.</p>

<p class=B>For the Windows version only, this switch allows one to customize
the menu text for the macro running commands, taking two parameters, the macro
from 1-48 whose menu item to change, and the new text to put on the menu. An
ampersand &amp; may be used to put an underscore under the character
following it, which will be used as the standard Windows menu shortcut for the
command. For example, doing -WM 12 &quot;Best friend's chart, will edit the
last item on the Edit Run Macro (Normal Set) submenu to read Best friend's
chart. After it will still appear F12 as this doesn't change the direct
keyboard shortcut. (One should of course also use the -M0 switch to assign a
macro to slot 12 here to actually display your friends chart when the macro is
run.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Wn:</span> Don't redraw screen until user forces
update.</p>

<p class=B>For the Windows version only, this switch toggles it so that the
window will not redraw its contents until you force an update (with the Redraw
Screen command or by pressing space). Normally the screen updates after every
command or whenever a section of the window gets uncovered. However this
constant redrawing may cause unwanted waiting on a slower system, especially if
one is tweaking various minor settings in say a large transit search, and
doesn't want to wait after each modification.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Wh:</span> Set hourglass cursor when redrawing chart.</p>

<p class=B>This switch toggles whether the Windows version shows an hourglass
mouse pointer while calculating and drawing charts. This setting is on by
default, but one may want to turn it off during animations to prevent the mouse
pointer from continually flashing to and from the hourglass.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Wt:</span> Don't display warning and error popup
messages.</p>

<p class=B>This switch disables warning popup messages in the Windows version,
such as ephemeris files not being found. One scenario where this can be used is
star charts for the distant past or future. Heliocentric barycentric positions
of fixed stars dont require calculating the position of the Sun, and therefore
can be calculated for any date and dont depend on ephemeris files being
available. However, Astrolog will still warn about dates out of range, which
can be ignored in this scenario. For example, the animation <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/dipper2.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/dipper2.gif</a>
covering a million years was generated with -Wt on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Ww &lt;hor&gt; &lt;ver&gt;:</span> Set upper left
coordinates of window.</p>

<p class=B>In the Windows version, this switch (taking two parameters) will
change the coordinates of the origin of the programs window. This is a way to
precisely or programmatically position or move the window.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-WB &lt;0-24&gt; &lt;0-24&gt;:</span> Set window
scrollbar positions.</p>

<p class=B>In the Windows version, this switch sets the windows scrollbars.
Its two parameters specify the horizontal and vertical scrollbar positioning.
Both are numbers from 0-24, in which 0 is the left or top edge, 24 is the right
or bottom edge, and 12 is centered in the middle.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Wo:</span> Continually autosave graphics screen to
bitmap file.</p>

<p class=B>In the Windows version, this switch causes the program to
automatically save a bitmap of the current graphics screen to a bitmap file
astrolog.bmp, whenever the screen is updated. This specialized feature allows
external programs to get the current state of Astrologs screen, which can be
used for scenarios such as creating the following video: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euxwoyekZow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euxwoyekZow</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Wo0:</span> Continually autosave graphics screen to
numbered files.</p>

<p class=B>In the Windows version, this switch causes the program to
automatically save a bitmap of the current graphics screen to a continually
increasing sequence of bitmap files whenever the screen is updated, to
ast00000.bmp, ast00001.bmp, and so on. Each time the -Wo0 switch is
invoked, the counter will be reset to zero. This specialized feature allows
external programs to see a list of Astrolog screenshots, which can be used for
scenarios such as creating animated GIFs: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/globe.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/globe.gif</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Wo3:</span> Autosave graphics screen to wireframe
instead of bitmap.</p>

<p class=B>The Windows version can automatically generate and save Daedalus
wireframe files as new graphics charts are displayed. This switch is just like
-Wo, except that a wireframe file instead of a bitmap will be automatically
generated and saved to file. The program Daedalus can be configured to
automatically open and display such files. If Astrolog is animating the chart,
then the wireframe rendered in Daedalus will be animating in the same manner,
which allows creating videos such as: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdRaDGXBV-0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdRaDGXBV-0</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-WSg:</span> Setup Windows program group, for current
user only.</p>

<p class=B>In the Windows version, this switch creates a Windows program group
for the current user containing pointers to the Astrolog executable, the main
and update documentation files, and the Astrolog website.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-WSG:</span> Setup Windows program group, for all
users.</p>

<p class=B>In the Windows version, this switch creates the same program group,
but for all users.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-WSd:</span> Setup Windows desktop icon for program.</p>

<p class=B>In the Windows version, this switch creates a Windows desktop icon
to launch Astrolog.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-WSx:</span> Setup registering Windows file extensions
for program.</p>

<p class=B>In the Windows version, this switch associates Astrolog with .as extension
files in the Windows registry. Note that the special switch -setup will setup
a Windows program group for the current user, a desktop icon, and file
extensions for program (which is basically a shortcut for the combination of -WSg
-WSd -WSx).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-WSu:</span> Unregister Windows file extensions for
program.</p>

<p class=B>In the Windows version, this switch undoes the effect of the
previous switch, and unassociates Astrolog from .as extension files, which is
useful for uninstall. Note these last two switches edit the current users
settings within the Windows registry.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-WZ:</span> Treat program as screen saver, and exit
next user input.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can act as a Windows screen saver. To use it as one, copy
the Astrolog.exe executable to the file Astrolog.scr in your Windows system
directory (which is usually C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32). The right directory is the
one that has other .scr extension screen savers in it. Once installed, in
Windows select Start / Settings / Control Panel / Display / Screen Saver or
equivalent, and pick Astrolog from the list. When Previewed or when started
as a screen saver, the default display will be a wheel chart starting from the
current moment now and animating forward a minute at a time. If the file
astrolog.as exists in the same directory as Astrolog.scr, then that file will
be loaded on startup, which can change the default behavior. You cant set an
unlock password when Astrolog is running as a screen saver, and the Settings
button wont do anything other than show the same animation within a window.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog knows to act as a screen saver when Windows invokes it with
specific command switches, and will exit immediately when a key is pressed or
the mouse is moved. Astrolog /s (run screen saver) will run in full screen
mode. Astrolog /c and Astrolog /a (configure screen saver) will run in
windowed mode. Astrolog /p (preview screen saver) will do nothing. One can
invoke Astrolog with these switches to test its screen saver functionality, or
use the -WZ switch, which will turn on the internal mode which makes the
program exit on the next user action.</p>

<p class=Section2>Astrolog (version 7.10) obscure command switches:</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Y:</span> Display help list of less commonly used
command switches.</p>

<p class=B>This switch was described in an earlier section.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YT:</span> Compute true positions in space instead of
apparent in sky.</p>

<p class=B>This switch turns on true planetary positions, which means where
planets actually are in space. Normally Astrolog shows apparent positions,
which is where planets appear in the sky, or the true positions adjusted by the
travel time of the speed of light. Most astrologers and astrology software work
with apparent positions (although theres no definitive proof that astrological
influences travel at the speed of light). True positions will be up to half an
arc-minute ahead of apparent positions, e.g. light from the Sun takes about 8
minutes to reach Earth, so the Sun has moved forward another 8 clock minutes
through the zodiac. For the -S orbit chart, in which one is looking down at the
solar system as a whole, its recommended to have true positions on (and
topocentric positions off).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YV:</span> Compute topocentric positions instead of
from center of body.</p>

<p class=B>This switch turns on topocentric positions, which means positions
relative to ones location on the surface of the Earth. Normally Astrolog shows
positions relative to the center of the Earth. Most astrologers and astrology
software treat the Earth as a single point (although theres no definitive
proof that astrological influences affect everybody on all parts of the Earth
equally). Because topocentric is relative to location on Earth, ones elevation
above sea level influences positions, and needs to be set separately (with the
-zv switch). Positions with this setting may be different by more than half a
degree, with the maximum change being the Moon (because its closest to the
Earth) and when planets are near the horizon, because in those cases parallax
has the biggest opportunity to alter positioning. Topocentric positions require
Swiss Ephemeris to be active (which it is by default) in order to work, and
also for the chart to be geocentric. For the -Z local horizon chart, in which one
is looking at points of light in the sky from their local position on Earth,
its recommended to have topocentric positions on (and true positions off).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yh:</span> Compute location of solar system
barycenter instead of Sun.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog supports barycentric charts with this switch, which has
positions relative to the solar system barycenter, or the solar systems center
of mass. Barycentric is similar to heliocentric charts centered around the Sun,
however the solar system barycenter will vary from the Suns position based on
the positions of the planets (especially Jupiter which is the most massive).
The solar system barycenter ranges from inside the Suns body to about one Sun
radius from it. For geocentric charts, this setting will make the Suns
position be the barycenter instead of the Sun itself, which can affect its
position in geocentric charts by up to half a degree. In heliocentric charts,
all positions will be relative to the barycenter instead of to the Sun.</p>

<p class=N><span class=S>-Ym:</span> Position planetary moons around current central
object.</p>

<p class=B>This switch turns on a mode such that planetary moons and other
objects orbiting planets are displayed as orbiting the central object instead.
This will also affect Earths Moon, the Moons Nodes, and Lilith. (In addition,
when another star is the central object, planets orbiting our Sun will instead
be made to orbit the other star system.) Planetary moons are usually very close
to the planet they orbit, making it necessary to do a planet centered chart to
get a good look at the relative orientation of its moons. In other words, this
option overlays planet centered moon positions with the standard natal chart.
Because a planet is a mini-solar system, there can be sympathetic connections
between moons around a planet, and planets around the Sun at the same relative
angle (or even between moons around different planets that are at the same
relative angles).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Ys:</span> Sidereal zodiac positions are in plane of
solar system.</p>

<p class=B>This will modify sidereal zodiac positions to be relative to the
plane of the solar system (instead of relative to the plane of the ecliptic,
which is the default). The difference is subtle, especially for centuries near
the present, however the solar system plane is stable relative to the
background of stars, in comparison to the ecliptic which does change slightly over
time. As a result this option is useful for stellar animations spanning many
thousands of years. For example, the animation <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/dipper2.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/dipper2.gif</a>
covering a million years was generated with -Ys on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yn:</span> Compute location of true instead of mean
node.</p>

<p class=B>This switch sets whether the North Node and South Node in Astrolog
(objects number 16 and 17) are the mean or the true nodes of the Moon. This
also affects whether Lilith (object number 18) is the mean or true Dark Moon. The
mean node is the default, but toggling on the -Yn flag will do the true node.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yn0:</span> Don't consider nutation in tropical
zodiac positions.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog (and the Swiss Ephemeris that it uses) takes into account
nutation, or the periodic subtle wobble of Earths axis. The new -Yn0 switch
will turn nutation off for the tropical zodiac. (Nutation is always properly
ignored in the fixed sidereal zodiac.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yu:</span> Display eclipse and occultation
information in charts.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can accurately detect eclipses and occultations/transits,
or when one planets disk is partially covering another. To do this, turn on
this switch (which is also available as the Show Eclipse Information checkbox
in the Display Settings dialog). When active, appropriate charts will indicate
whether conjunctions and oppositions are eclipses. The aspect list (-a switch),
transit to transit times (-d), and transit to transit influence (-D) charts
will display next to each aspect if its an eclipse, and if so whether its
total (or an occultation in which one body completely covers another), annular
(or a transit in which one body is passing in front of another), partial (in
which one body partially overlaps another), penumbral (in which part of the
Moon is in the Earths shadow, i.e. some part of the Moons surface is
experiencing a partial Solar eclipse), or total penumbral (a semi-rare
condition in which all of the Moon is within the Earths penumbra, but no part
of the Moon is in the full umbra). Eclipses are marked as total or annular only
if youre in the eclipses path during the time of totality or annularity. Note
that for accurate Solar Eclipse times, such as detecting when totality begins
and ends, your location on Earth is very important, so you should have
topocentric positions on (-YV switch). Similarly, for Lunar Eclipses you want
to consider the effect of Earths shadow from the geocentric middle of the
planet, which means you should have topocentric positions off.</p>

<p class=B>If the print nearest minute setting (-b0 switch) is in effect, then
any eclipses will include the percentage of the planets diameter involved. For
example, for partial eclipses it will range from 1% (just beginning to cover)
to 99% (just shy of totality or annularity). For annular and total eclipses it
will range from 1% (complete overlap just begin) to 100% (planets middles
perfectly centered at the same position). For penumbral eclipses it will range
from 1% (Moon just entering Earths penumbra) to 100% (totally within
penumbra).</p>

<p class=B>The transit to transit graphs (-B switch) will graph the intensity
of an eclipse over time. In the text mode transit graph, times during eclipses
will be marked by special characters: Total eclipses or occultations are
indicated by T, annular eclipses or transits are A, partial eclipses are
P, and penumbral lunar eclipses are p. In graphics mode, a second graph
will be drawn in dark blue overlapping the first. The height of this graph will
indicate the type of eclipse and its percentage progression: Penumbral eclipses
will range from 1/12 to 3/12 height of the area, partial eclipses will range
from 5/12 to 7/12, and annular or total from 9/12 to 11/12. These three zones
make it easy to see (for example) a lunar eclipse progressing over time, and
when it moves from penumbral to partial to total.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yd:</span> Display dates in D/M/Y instead of M/D/Y
format.</p>

<p class=B>This is a switch which determines whether dates are displayed in
Month/Day/Year order or in the more European Day/Month/Year format. Toggling
on or off this flag will specify the DMY or MDY format everywhere in the
program from text wheel charts to transit charts to the chart info displayed in
graphics charts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yt:</span> Display times in 24 hour instead of am/pm
format.</p>

<p class=B>This is another option which is just like the above except that it
affects how times are displayed throughout the program. When clear, times will
be printed in am/pm format, while when set they will be in the more European 24
hour clock.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yv:</span> Display distance in metric instead of
imperial units.</p>

<p class=B>When the program displays distances, its normally in imperial units
(feet or miles). This switch will instead display distances in metric units
(meters or kilometers).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yr:</span> Round positions to nearest unit instead of
crop fraction.</p>

<p class=B>This switch displays zodiac positions rounded up or down to the
nearest minute (or second when -b0 is active). Normally Astrolog displays
positions by dropping any fractional part, so for example a position of 12Lib34
means the actual position is somewhere between 12Lib34:00 and 12Lib34:59. Not
rounding is better when animating Astrolog, so for example the moment when
29Sag59:59 turns to 0Cap00:00 is the exact instant of the Solstice.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YC:</span> Automatically ignore insignificant house
cusp aspects.</p>

<p class=B>This option toggles on a useful flag to automatically prevent
display of irrelevant or redundant aspects involving house cusps, processing
them in a more intuitive manner. This affects charts such as -t transit search
lists, -T transit influence charts, and -a aspect lists. First, aspects other
than conjunctions to minor cusps will be ignored, e.g. a sextile to the 12th
house cusp is redundant and isn't really useful, as we are more interested in
the conjunction to the 2nd house. Minor aspects to the angles such as the
Ascendant and Midheaven are left alone. The setting also prevents redundant
aspects to two items that are always opposite each other, e.g. if a transit
list shows a trine to the Midheaven, it won't show a sextile to the Descendant
right next to it. However, if one object has been restricted, then any aspect
will be allowed to an object always opposite it (e.g. if Ascendant restricted
allow any aspect to the Descendant). Also if one aspect has been restricted,
anything involving the supplemental aspect will be allowed (e.g. if Trine
restricted allow all Sextiles).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YO:</span> Automatically adjust settings when
exporting and printing.</p>

<p class=B>This flag tells Astrolog to do the smart thing when exporting
charts to other formats. This setting has two effects: (1) When printing, if
the chart background is black (which it is by default) then the program will
automatically reverse it to white when printing. That avoids the problem of
printing and getting a mostly black piece of paper, which wastes ink. (2) When
saving text charts or copying them to the clipboard, Ansi color will be
temporarily turned off. That avoids getting Ansi escape sequence characters in
the text, which in most cases isnt wanted because the escape sequences arent
parsed in most contexts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Y8:</span> Clip text charts at the rightmost (e.g.
80th) column.</p>

<p class=B>This setting when active will stop printing lines of text within
charts if theyre long enough to go beyond the right edge of the screen. This
can be used to prevent text from wrapping around the screen to the next line.
By default, with all objects unrestricted, certain charts will have rows more
than 80 columns wide, which can break up the chart making it difficult to read,
e.g. the -r0 -g relationship aspect grid, the -E ephemeris listing, and the -L
astro-graph columns when Uranians are included. With this option on however,
these and any other charts that can go beyond column 80, will always be
displayed on one line, with columns that would go beyond the 80th not getting
printed. Note that this setting can actually clip at any column instead of just
the 80th, where the screen width value used is the same as used for
interpretation formatting, i.e. the optional parameter to the -I switch.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YQ &lt;rows&gt;:</span> Pause text scrolling after a
page full has printed.</p>

<p class=B>This feature gives you the option to have Astrolog automatically
stop whenever the screen gets filled with text and prompt before scrolling to
the next page. It takes one parameter to define the number of rows to print
before prompting the user to press return to continue. If set to zero, the
feature will be turned off and Astrolog will print continuously until done.
This helps those who may be concerned about the program scrolling things off
the screen before they can read it. Without this one would have to press Ctrl-s
to have the system pause printing, send output to a file to inspect afterward,
or be on a system with scrollbars to see everything. This feature is off by
default, but can easily be changed to a common screen height such as 24 rows in
the astrolog.as file. When the program is paused, one can type a couple things
before pressing return: Entering q or . will terminate the program,
entering Q will turn off the feature and scroll until done, 8 will toggle
the right hand column clipping setting, and k will toggle the Ansi color
setting.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yq[0-9] &lt;strings&gt;:</span> Define command lines
to run and show in sequence.</p>

<p class=B>This obscure switch allows appending multiple text charts within a
single display. It takes between 0-9 parameters, depending on whether its
invoked as -Yq0, -Yq1, and so on. If theres no digit character after -Yq, then
its assumed to have zero parameters, and will turn off this feature. Astrolog
will treat each parameter as a command line, and then display the resulting
chart after each command line is processed. This is basically equivalent to
having a batch script invoke Astrolog several times in a row and appending the
results together. For example, -Yq2 &quot;-n _e =dm -R0 Sun Moo -A 0 -RA Opp
-YR0 1 1&quot; &quot;-i set _e _d _YR Mer Eas 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
0 0&quot; will cast a chart for the time of the Full Moon this month.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yi[0-9] &lt;path&gt;:</span> Specify directory to
search within for files.</p>

<p class=B>This switch is a way to specify search paths for loading files, such
as ephemeris files and chart information files. It takes one parameter
indicating a directory to look within for files. There are actually ten
different switches -Yi0 through -Yi9 (in which -Yi by itself is equivalent to
-Yi0) which can cover ten different paths. The default astrolog.as default
settings file contains a couple instances of -Yi pointing to sample
directories. Note that -Yi cant be used to help find astrolog.as itself for
its initial loading, because the astrolog.as file is loaded early before even
the command line is processed. However, because the directory of the executable
is searched before anything else, placing astrolog.as next to the executable
will ensure its found, and -Yi switches inside astrolog.as can be used to
point to any other paths. System environment variables pointing to directories
such as ASTROLOG are supported, but arent necessary to define file paths.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yo:</span> Output chart info and position files in
old style format.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can still read in all old style -o info and -o0 position
chart files generated by previous versions of the program without problem. Not
only that, but it will write out these old formats too if the -Yo switch is put
into effect. When set, it will output -o and -o0 files exactly as in version
4.10 and before, in simple lists of numbers in fixed fields instead of in
generic command switch files.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yc:</span> Angular cusp objects are house positions
instead of angles.</p>

<p class=B>This switch determines whether the angular house cusp objects (i.e. object
indexes 22, 25, 28, and 31) contain the position of their respective house
cusps, or the positions of the Ascendant, Nadir, Descendant, and Midheaven.
These positions are always the same except for certain house systems, e.g. in
the Equal house system the position of the 10th cusp is different from the
Midheaven. Normally the angular house objects always contain the positions of
the Asc, MC, etc, however this feature gives the user the option to have the
objects contents be the positions of the cusps as defined by the house system
in use. Similarly, the default graphic glyphs for the Asc/MC/Des/IC objects are
those letter abbreviations. When this setting is on, the default graphic glyphs
will instead be the number of the house cusp, and also the display text used
for the object will indicate the house number instead of the angles name. This
will make it clearer what is actually being shown, transited over, and so on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yp:</span> Fix polar houses by preserving Ascendant
instead of MC.</p>

<p class=B>When a chart is cast in a polar region within the Arctic or Antarctic Circle, the Ascendant may be more than 180 degrees after the MC, which makes it
impossible to have proper house cusps (at least for systems that associate the
Asc with the 1st house and the MC with the 10th). Normally Astrolog addresses
this by flipping the Ascendant 180 degrees if its in the wrong half of the
zodiac. If the -Yp switch is set, the MC will be flipped 180 degrees instead.
This setting has no effect when Swiss Ephemeris is active and computing house
cusps.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yz &lt;min&gt;:</span> Forward clock by amount for
current moment charts.</p>

<p class=B>This obscure switch, taking one parameter for the number of minutes,
allows one to offset forward or backward the time considered to be the current
moment now. This is useful if your -n now charts always seem to be a few hours or
whatever off, as seems to be the case on certain Mac or Amiga systems. For
example, if -n says its 3:30pm when its really 1:30pm, doing -Yz -120 will
back up the clock appropriately (and change the planetary positions slightly
too). Its important that this switch be used as a last resort instead of
first, where one should first check their system time, the system time zone
setting such as may be set with the TZ environment variable, and Astrologs
default time zone. A line for this setting appears in the default astrolog.as
file.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Y1[0] &lt;obj1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt;:</span> Rotate
planets so one is at other's position.</p>

<p class=B>This switch is similar to the existing -1 solar chart switch, except
instead of rotating house cusps by an offset so theyre at a planets position,
this rotates all planets by an offset so theyre at the original position of
some planet. This switch takes two parameters specifying planets that represent
an offset, such that after shifting, the first planet is at the original
position of the second. If the switch is invoked as -Y10, it will instead
rotate everything so the first planet is at the start of the sign of the second
planets original position. This option is considered turned off and will have
no effect if the two parameters are the same (and the 0 part isnt active).
This general feature allows generating certain types of charts, such as Esoteric
Astrology wheels and Draconic charts. A Draconic chart is where all planet
positions are rotated such that the North Node is at 0Aries, which means -Y1 Nod
Vul (with Vul being a restricted object or one forced to be located at
0Aries) will produce a Draconic chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yl &lt;1-36&gt;:</span> Toggle plus zone status of
sector for sector chart.</p>

<p class=B>This command switch is used with the -l sector charts and sets whether
a sector is a plus zone sector or not. Taking one parameter of a sector number,
it toggles the plus zone status of it. Like the -R restriction switches, the _
prefix may be used to make a sector minus and the = prefix to make a sector
plus.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YP &lt;-1,0,1&gt;:</span> Set how Arabic parts are
computed for night charts.</p>

<p class=B>This is an obscure option allowing one to force whether night chart
formula inverting is done in the -P Arabic part chart list, since sources
differ on which parts are best inverted. This option takes one parameter,
either -1, 0, or 1. Zero is the default setting, meaning the program will
invert only those parts that have the flip flag set, for charts cast at night.
If the setting is 1, then no inverting will ever be done for any part, even in
night charts. If the setting is -1, then inverting will always be done for
every part, even in day charts. Note that the Part of Fortune does appear both
in the -P full part list, as well as being the only part thats also a standard
object (object #19) meaning its the only part one may automatically do aspects
or transits to. Note also that the -P list the Part of Fortune inverts for
night charts, meaning the standard object in the main list does too.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yb &lt;days&gt;:</span> Set number of days to span
for biorhythm chart.</p>

<p class=B>This switch, taking one parameter, specifies how many days to
include in the biorhythm charts. It will control the number of days spanned in
the text biorhythm listing, and number of days plotted before and after the
given day in the graphic biorhythm chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Ye &lt;obj&gt; &lt;index&gt;:</span> Change orbit of
Uranian to seorbel.txt object.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog supports custom planets beyond the set of objects it
normally works with. This switch customizes planet positions. It takes two
parameters: One for the object to replace, and another for the object to
replace it with. The source object must be one of the objects in the Uranian
hypothetical object category (Vulcan or one of the eight Uranians). The
destination object is defined by an index in the seorbel.txt text file in the
Astrolog install directory. For example, -Ye Cup 9 will replace Cupido with
Isis-Transpluto, and -Ye Had 18 will replace Hades with Porserpina. The name
and glyphs in the program wont change, but the positions will reflect the new
object. Note this feature requires Swiss Ephemeris to be active (which it is by
default) in order to take effect.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yeb &lt;obj&gt; &lt;index&gt;:</span> Change orbit of
Uranian to external ephemeris.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can access custom bodies whose positions are in external
Swiss Ephemeris format ephemeris files (such as Eris and Sedna) with the -Yeb
switch. This is similar to the -Ye switch which allows accessing the orbital
elements of fictitious bodies in the seorbel.txt file. Simply download the
desired ephemeris file from <a href="ftp://ftp.astro.com/pub/swisseph/ephe/">ftp://ftp.astro.com/pub/swisseph/ephe/</a>
and place it in the same directory as the other ephemeris files. Pass the
number of the ephemeris file to the -Yeb switch, and the Uranian object in
question will be replaced with the positions of the new object. For example, to
show the position of Eris, download <a
href="ftp://ftp.astro.com/pub/swisseph/ephe/ast136/s136199.se1">ftp://ftp.astro.com/pub/swisseph/ephe/ast136/s136199.se1</a>
and then do -Yeb Cup 136199 to replace the position of Cupido with Eris. See <a
href="http://www.astro.com/swisseph/astlist.htm">http://www.astro.com/swisseph/astlist.htm</a>
for an index of which asteroids map to which numbers. You may also want to
change the objects name and graphic glyph to complete the customization.</p>

<p class=N><span class=S>-Yem &lt;obj&gt; &lt;index&gt;:</span> Change orbit of
Uranian to planet moon ephemeris.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can access planetary moons whose positions are in Swiss
Ephemeris format ephemeris files (such as Saturns Titan and Jupiters Ganymede)
with the -Yem switch. This is like -Yeb, except it references a planetary moon
ephemeris file instead of an asteroid ephemeris file. Planetary moon ephemeris
files have filenames like sepm9XYZ.se1, in which XYZ is the designation for
the moon. In this designation, X is the planet being orbited (4=Mars,
5=Jupiter, 6=Saturn, 7=Uranus, 8=Neptune, 9=Pluto) and YZ is the moon in
question. For example, sepm9501.se1 defines Jupiters Moon Io. This moon can
be assigned to Cupidos object slot with -Yem Cup 501. Also, moon #99 is
the true non-barycentric position of the planet, e.g. sepm9599.se1 defines
the actual position of Jupiters center of body taking into account the
gravitational perturbations of its moons (in comparison to the standard Jupiter
planet object which is the center of mass of the Jupiter system). For more
about planetary moons, how to use and interpret them in astrology, and how to
display them in Astrolog, see: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/astmoon.htm">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/astmoon.htm</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YeO &lt;obj1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt;:</span> Change orbit of
Uranian to internal planet.<br>
<span class=S>-Ye[..]n &lt;obj&gt; &lt;index&gt;:</span> Change Uranian to
North Node of object.<br>
<span class=S>-Ye[..]s &lt;obj&gt; &lt;index&gt;:</span> Change Uranian to
South Node of object.<br>
<span class=S>-Ye[..]a &lt;obj&gt; &lt;index&gt;:</span> Change Uranian to
apihelion of object.<br>
<span class=S>-Ye[..]p &lt;obj&gt; &lt;index&gt;:</span> Change Uranian to
perihelion of object.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can access the nodes and helion points of planets, by
defining them as custom bodies. The -Ye command switch can be invoked in four
different ways to select these points: -Yen for the north or ascending node,
-Yes for the south or descending node, -Yep for the perihelion point or point
on its orbit nearest the Sun, and -Yea for the aphelion point or point farthest
from the Sun. (For the Moon, -Yep and -Yea produce the perigee and apogee
points nearest to and farthest from the Earth.) These four points exist in
space, and the planet in question will pass through them along its orbit. As
with the Moons nodes, Astrologs true node vs. mean node setting (-Yn switch)
will influence these positions. The -Ye switch is invoked in one of three ways
to indicate the type of object in question: -Ye by itself for fictitious bodies
in seorbel.txt, -Yeb for asteroids in custom ephemeris files, and -YeO for an
existing planet in Astrologs standard list. For example, -Yen Cup 9
redefines Cupidos slot to be the north node of Transpluto or seorbel.txt
object #9, -Yebs Cup 9 redefines Cupido to be the south node of the asteroid
Metis assuming se00009s.se1 has been downloaded, and -YeOa Cup 9 redefines
Cupido to be the aphelion point of Neptune or Astrolog object #9. (Warning: The
-Yen example and others like it dont actually work, because node and helion
points of seorbel.txt objects arent implemented yet.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Ye[..]HSBNTV &lt;obj&gt; &lt;index&gt;:</span> Toggle
heliocentric, sidereal zodiac, barycentric, true node, true position, or
topocentric for object.</p>

<p class=B>The -Ye switch allows the custom objects to have different settings
from the default. For example, this feature can allow displaying the true node
alongside the mean node and check for aspects between them, or plot how the
Suns position changes over time relative to the solar system barycenter. The
-Ye switch can be ended with six different subswitch characters, which may be
chained together to toggle multiple settings at once:</p>

<p class=B>-YeH: Toggle the heliocentric setting of the customized object (-h
switch).<br>
-YeS: Toggle the sidereal zodiac setting of the customized object (-s switch).<br>
-YeB: Toggle the barycentric setting of the customized object (-Yh switch).<br>
-YeN: Toggle the true node setting of the customized object (-Yn switch).<br>
-YeT: Toggle the true positions setting of the customized object (-YT switch).<br>
-YeV: Toggle the topocentric positions setting of the customized object (-YV
switch).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YE &lt;obj&gt; &lt;semi-major axis&gt;
&lt;eccentricity (3)&gt; &lt;inclination (3)&gt; &lt;perihelion (3)&gt;
&lt;ascending node (3)&gt; &lt;time offset (3)&gt;:</span> Change orbit of
object to be the given elements.</p>

<p class=B>This feature allows one to define their own planets, by changing
the orbital elements of one of Astrologs objects. This switch takes 17
parameters, which specify all the data needed for any elliptical orbit around
the Sun. The parameters are as follows: First is the object to redefine; second
is the semi-major axis of the new orbit, in AU; next are three parameters for
the eccentricity of the orbits ellipse; next are three parameters for the
inclination of the orbit with respect to the ecliptic, in degrees; next are
three parameters for the argument of perihelion, which is the rotation of the
orbit in degrees or how far away its perihelion is from zero Aries; next are
three parameters defining the ascending node, which is the tilt of the orbit
or how far away the point where the orbit intersects the ecliptic is from zero
Aries; finally are three parameters for the mean anomaly which is basically
where on the orbit the planet is at a reference time and how fast it moves
along it. Many of the above element settings take three values when it seems
like only one is needed. The second and third values are used as linear and
quadratic error factors to the first, and can be zero unless every last bit of
accuracy that can be provided outside of ephemeris files is needed. Note that
these parameters basically replace the same elements as used in the old Matrix formulas.
This means the -YE switch settings are ignored when the -b ephemeris flag is in
effect. Note also that the Matrix formulas have special error factors applied
on top of their main elements for Jupiter through Pluto, hence its recommended
to only redefine asteroids, Uranians, or inner planets. The following example
will roughly move Venus into Earths orbit: -YE 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 23000. Note this feature requires the old Matrix formulas (-bm switch) to be
on in order to take effect.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YU &lt;obj&gt; &lt;name&gt;:</span> Change position
of star to sefstars.txt entry.</p>

<p class=B>Astrologs list of stars can be customized. The -YU command switch
takes two parameters: The existing object index or star name to replace, and a
string for a star name from the file sefstars.txt in the Astrolog install
directory to compute instead. This star name can be the traditional or common
name in the first column of the file, or the scientific nomenclature name in
the second column of the file if the name starts with a comma. For example,
-YU Achernar Deneb or -YU 43 ,alCyg will both replace the star Achernar (object
#43) with the star Deneb or Alpha Cygni. You may also want to change the
objects name to complete the customization. If a star is renamed to  or the
empty string, then that will turn off customization for that slot, and return
to Astrologs internal default. This feature requires Swiss Ephemeris to be the
active method of star computation in order to work.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YUb:</span> Adjust star brightness to apparent
magnitude based on distance.</p>

<p class=B>Star brightness is usually a fixed value indicating the stars
magnitude as currently viewed from Earth. This switch adjusts star brightness
based on the stars current distance from the central object. This is useful
when doing charts for extreme past or future times (in which the stars have
drifted to different distances and therefore brightnesses) and especially when
casting charts centered on other star systems (which have a more immediate
effect on distance and brightness). For example, the star Sirius is magnitude
-1.46 now, however in the year 38,000 when its closer to our Sun it will have
brightened to -1.57, and by the year 300,000 it will have dimmed to just +0.01.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YUb0:</span> Set brightness to distance independent
absolute magnitude.</p>

<p class=B>This switch makes brightness be displayed as a stars absolute
magnitude, or the inherent brightness of the star independent of distance
(which is defined as the magnitude of the star when viewed from 10 parsecs or
32.6 light years away).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YR &lt;obj1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt; &lt;flag1&gt;..&lt;flag2&gt;:</span>
Set restrictions for object range.</p>

<p class=B>This is like the -R switch except that it explicitly sets the
restrictions for a range of Astrolog objects instead of just one. The first two
parameters specify the lower and upper object bounds, and are followed by zero
or one flag parameters to clear or set the restriction status of each object
within the range.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YRT &lt;obj1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt;
&lt;flag1&gt;..&lt;flag2&gt;:</span> Transit restrictions for range.</p>

<p class=B>This behaves exactly like the -YR switch above except it affects
transit restrictions, like how the -RT switch is to -R.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YR0 &lt;flag1&gt; &lt;flag2&gt;:</span> Set
restrictions for sign, direction changes.</p>

<p class=B>This sets the restriction status for sign and direction changes. It
takes two parameter flags, with the first setting for sign changes, and the
second direction changes. This affects the -d daily event searches, and works
like the -R restrictions but for all types of these special events, instead of
all aspects or all events containing a particular object.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YRZ &lt;rise&gt; &lt;zenith&gt; &lt;set&gt;
&lt;nadir&gt;:</span> Set restrictions for -Zd chart.</p>

<p class=B>This switch allows one to determine which events appear in the -Zd
rising and setting time chart. It takes four parameters, which respectively
control whether rising events, zenith transit events, setting events, and nadir
transit events are included in the chart. A zero value indicates to include
that event, while a one means to restrict it. For example, to include only
rising and setting events in the -Zd chart, do -YRZ 0 1 0 1. These
restrictions also affect the -L graphic astro-graph chart, and will control
whether the Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant, and Nadir lines are drawn.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YR7 &lt;ruler&gt; &lt;exalt&gt; &lt;eso&gt;
&lt;hier&gt; &lt;ray&gt;:</span> Set rulership restrictions.</p>

<p class=B>This switch controls what types of rulerships and exaltations are
shown in charts. It takes five parameters, one for each of the five types of
rulerships: Standard rulerships, esoteric rulerships, Hierarchical rulerships,
exaltations, and Ray Rulerships. As with other restriction switches, a zero
value means show, and non-zero means restrict. The astrolog.as default settings
file contains a line for these variables. Rulership restrictions will affect
whats shown in the standard -v chart list, whats shown in the -7 esoteric
chart, and also what set of rulerships is used in the graphic -J switch
dispositor chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YRd &lt;div&gt;:</span> Set divisions within signs to
search for degree changes.</p>

<p class=B>The transit to transit times search (-d switch) can include
planetary crossovers into a new degree. This is similar to the existing feature
of the chart which shows planetary crossovers into a new sign. This switch
determines how many sections to divide each sign into, when checking for a
planet crossing into a new section. Only if this setting is greater than one
will it introduce new events in to the transit times list. For example, setting
it to 2 will divide each sign into two halves and display when planets transit
the 15 degree mark of each sign, setting to 3 will divide each sign into three
pieces and display when planets cross the 10 and 20 degree marks, 30 will
display when planets cross each degree, and so on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YRh:</span> Don't auto(un)restrict central planet
when changing it.</p>

<p class=B>Changing the central planet will automatically unrestrict the old
central planet and restrict the new central planet from appearing in charts.
For example, switching from geocentric to heliocentric (through either the
Windows interface or the command line) will automatically restrict the Sun and
unrestrict the Earth to reflect what looks best in a heliocentric chart.
Restrictions will only be changed if both the old central planet is restricted
and the new central planet is unrestricted. This behavior is active by default,
but can be prevented with the -YRh switch. If turned on, then no restrictions
will change when the central planet is changed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YRU[0] &lt;starlist&gt;:</span> Restrict or focus on
list of extra stars.</p>

<p class=B>The collection of extra stars shown by the Show All Stars setting
(-XU switch) supports ways of focusing upon or excluding certain stars. The
-YRU switch will restrict certain stars from appearing, while the -YRU0 switch
will make only certain stars appear and ignore all the rest. It takes one
parameter, a comma separated list of strings indicating star names. For
example, -YRU0 Alkaid,Mizar,Alioth,Megrez,Phecda,Merak,Dubhe will make the extra
stars feature only show the seven stars of the Big Dipper, and skip all other
stars.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YAo &lt;asp1&gt; &lt;asp2&gt;
&lt;orb1&gt;..&lt;orb2&gt;:</span> Set aspect orbs for range.</p>

<p class=B>This is like -Ao but sets the orbs for a range of Astrolog aspects
instead of just one. The first two parameters specify the lower and upper
aspect index bounds, and are followed by a list of orb values for each aspect
in the range.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YAm &lt;obj1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt;
&lt;orb1&gt;..&lt;orb2&gt;:</span> Set max planet orbs for range.</p>

<p class=B>This is like -Am but sets the maximum aspect orbs allowed to a range
of objects instead of just one. Again, the first two parameters are the lower
and upper object indexes, followed by the list of max orb values.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YAd &lt;obj1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt;
&lt;orb1&gt;..&lt;orb2&gt;:</span> Set planet orb additions for range.</p>

<p class=B>This is like -Ad but sets the planet orb addition values for a range
of objects instead of just one. Again, the first two parameters are the bound
indexes, and are followed by the list of planet orb additions.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YAa &lt;asp1&gt; &lt;asp2&gt;
&lt;ang1&gt;..&lt;ang2&gt;:</span> Set planet aspect angles for range.</p>

<p class=B>This is like -Aa but sets the angles to use for a range of aspects
instead of just one. Again, the first two parameters are the bound indexes, and
are followed by a list of angle degree values for each aspect in the range.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YAD &lt;asp&gt; &lt;name&gt; &lt;abbrev&gt;
&lt;glyph&gt;:</span> Customize display names of aspect.</p>

<p class=B>This changes the name of aspects, or what strings are used to
display them in charts. The feature is best used if one customizes an aspects
angle to a new value, to completely replace one aspect with another. This
switch takes four parameters: The aspect to rename, and then three strings for
the aspects new name, the aspects new three letter abbreviation, and a
description of the aspects glyph. Note that renaming aspects only changes how
theyre displayed in charts, which means command switches still need to refer
to the aspect by its default name.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yj &lt;obj1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt;
&lt;inf1&gt;..&lt;inf2&gt;:</span> Set influences for object range.</p>

<p class=B>This sets the powers or influences of the given range of planets,
when considered in a natal chart, as used in charts such as the -j influence
chart, -a aspect influence list, and -T transit influence list. Every object
has its own index, except fixed stars are collectively covered by slot #43 (the
index of the first fixed star). Setting that slot will set the influence for
all stars. Similarly, the command line will parse the string &quot;star&quot;
to match this index of the first star. For example, -Yj star star 4 will set
the influence of all stars to 4.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YjC &lt;cusp1&gt; &lt;cusp2&gt;
&lt;inf1&gt;..&lt;inf2&gt;:</span> Set influences for house cusps.</p>

<p class=B>This sets the influences for the given range of houses, as used in
charts such as -j.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YjA &lt;asp1&gt; &lt;asp2&gt;
&lt;inf1&gt;..&lt;inf2&gt;:</span> Set influences for aspect range.</p>

<p class=B>This sets the influences for the given range of aspects, as used in
charts such as the -j influence chart, -a aspect influence list, and -T and -D
transit lists.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YjT &lt;obj1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt;
&lt;inf1&gt;..&lt;inf2&gt;:</span> Set transit influences for range.</p>

<p class=B>This sets the influences of the given range of planets, just like
-Yj, except here for when the planets are transiting, as used in charts such as
the -T transit and -D external planets influence lists.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yj0 &lt;inf1&gt; &lt;inf2&gt; &lt;inf3&gt;
&lt;inf4&gt;:</span> Set influences given to planets in ruling sign, exalted
sign, ruling house, exalted house.</p>

<p class=B>This switch takes four parameters and sets respectively, the extra
influences given to a planet when its in the sign it rules, when its in the
sign it exalts in, when its in the house corresponding to the sign it rules,
and when its in the house corresponding to the sign it exalts in. These values
are used in examples such as the -j influence chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Yj7 &lt;inf1&gt; &lt;inf2&gt; &lt;inf3&gt;
&lt;inf4&gt; &lt;inf5&gt; &lt;inf6&gt;:</span> Set influences for in esoteric,
hierarchical, Ray ruling sign, plus same for house.</p>

<p class=B>This switch defines power numbers for esoteric positionings, as used
by the -7 switch esoteric charts. It takes six parameters. The first three are
the power added to a planet when its in the sign it esoterically rules, the
power when a planets in the sign it Hierarchically rules, and the power when a
planets in the sign it Ray rules. The second three are the same, but are the
power added to a planet when its in the house corresponding to the sign it
esoterically, Hierarchically, or Ray rules.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YJ &lt;obj&gt; &lt;sign&gt; &lt;cosign&gt;:</span>
Set sign planet rules and co-rules.</p>

<p class=B>This switch allows one to customize the rulerships of a given
planet. It takes three parameters, the object to modify, the zodiac sign for it
to rule, and a second sign for it to co-rule. Pass in the value zero to make a
planet not rule any sign. For example, Jupiter by default rules Sagittarius and
co-rules Pisces. If you'd prefer it to rule Cancer and not have a co-rulership,
do -YJ Jup Can 0.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YJ0 &lt;obj&gt; &lt;sign&gt;:</span> Set zodiac sign
given planet exalts in.</p>

<p class=B>Similar to the -YJ switch, this allows one to customize the zodiac
sign a given planet exalts in. It takes two parameters, the object to modify,
and the new sign to exalt in (with a zero value meaning no exaltation). For
example, to make Pluto exalt in Aries (and hence implicitly be debilitated in
the opposite sign Libra) do -YJ0 Plu Ari.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YJ7 &lt;obj&gt; &lt;sign&gt; &lt;cosign&gt;:</span>
Set signs planet esoterically rules.<br>
<span class=S>-YJ70 &lt;obj&gt; &lt;sign&gt; &lt;cosign&gt;:</span> Set signs
planet hierarchically rules.</p>

<p class=B>These switches customize esoteric and Hierarchical rulerships. They
are very similar to the -YJ switch that customizes a standard exoteric
rulership. These switches take three parameters: The planet to change the
rulership of, the sign that it rules, and a second sign that it also rules if
any.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Y7O &lt;obj1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt;
&lt;ray1&gt;..&lt;ray2&gt;:</span> Customize object rays.</p>

<p class=B>The Ray associated with each planet can be customized with this
switch. The first two parameters are the low and high object indexes to change.
The next parameters are the new Rays for objects within those indexes, ranging
from 1 to 7.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Y7C &lt;sign1&gt; &lt;sign2&gt;
&lt;rays1&gt;..&lt;rays2&gt;:</span> Customize sign rays.</p>

<p class=B>The Rays associated with each zodiac sign can be customized with
this switch. The first two parameters are the low and high sign indexes to
change. The next parameters are the set of Rays for each sign within those
indexes. Since a sign may be associated with more than one Ray, each setting
change may be multiple digits, for example -Y7C Cap Cap 137 will make
Capricorn associated with Rays 1, 3, and 7.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YI &lt;obj&gt; &lt;string&gt;:</span> Customize
interpretation for object.<br>
<span class=S>-YIa &lt;sign&gt; &lt;string&gt;:</span> Customize interpretation
adjective for sign.<br>
<span class=S>-YIv &lt;sign&gt; &lt;string&gt;:</span> Customize interpretation
verb for sign.<br>
<span class=S>-YIC &lt;house&gt; &lt;string&gt;:</span> Customize
interpretation for house.<br>
<span class=S>-YIA &lt;asp&gt; &lt;string&gt;:</span> Customize interpretation
for aspect.<br>
<span class=S>-YIA0 &lt;asp&gt; &lt;string&gt;:</span> Customize aspect
interpretation statement.</p>

<p class=B>You can customize the core phrases as used in Astrologs
interpretations. All these switches take two parameters: the index of the item
to change, and the string to set it to. (You probably want to enclose any
strings in quotes so they are treated as a single parameter and not split at
the spaces.) The things that can be changed and the switches to do them follow:</p>

<p class=B>-YI &lt;obj&gt; &lt;string&gt;: This sets the meaning for the given
planet or object, i.e. the part of ones mind the planet represents. For
example, the default setting for Jupiter would be: -YI 6 &quot;enthusiastic,
faithful, wise, expansive, spontaneous nature&quot;.</p>

<p class=B>-YIC &lt;house&gt; &lt;string&gt;: This sets the meaning for the
given house, i.e. the area of life that house represents. For example, the
default for the first house is: -YIC 1 &quot;establishment of personal
identity&quot;.</p>

<p class=B>-YIa &lt;sign&gt; &lt;string&gt;: This sets the characteristics for
the given sign, i.e. adjectives describing it. For example, the default for
Gemini is: -YIa 3 &quot;inquisitive, witty, perceptive, adaptable&quot;.</p>

<p class=B>-YIv &lt;sign&gt; &lt;string&gt;: This sets the desires for the
given sign, i.e. verbs describing what something characterized by it seeks. For
example, the default for Virgo is: -YIv 6 &quot;works toward perfection&quot;.</p>

<p class=B>-YIA &lt;asp&gt; &lt;string&gt;: This sets the meaning for the given
aspect, i.e. the type of interaction going on when the aspect is in effect. For
example, the default for the Trine is: -YIA 4 &quot;is in harmony with&quot;.
Special note: If the optional characters %s appear in the given string
anywhere, Astrolog will replace them with an appropriate adverb indicating how
strong the effect of the aspect is (and include the trailing space). For
example, the real default for Trine is: -YIA 4 &quot;is %sin harmony with,
where the %s will is replaced with &quot;always &quot;, &quot;somewhat
&quot;, etc, as appropriate.</p>

<p class=B>-YIA0 &lt;asp&gt; &lt;string&gt;: This sets the conclusion for the
given aspect, i.e. an additional sentence about it. For example, the default
for the Opposition is: -YIA0 5 &quot;Adaptation is required by both
sides&quot;.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YkO &lt;obj1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt;
&lt;col1&gt;..&lt;col2&gt;:</span> Customize planet colors.<br>
<span class=S>-YkC &lt;fir&gt; &lt;ear&gt; &lt;air&gt; &lt;wat&gt;:</span>
Customize element colors.<br>
<span class=S>-YkA &lt;asp1&gt; &lt;asp2&gt; &lt;col1&gt;..&lt;col2&gt;:</span>
Customize aspect colors.<br>
<span class=S>-Yk7 &lt;1..7&gt; &lt;1..7&gt; &lt;col1&gt;..&lt;col2&gt;:</span>
Customize Ray colors.<br>
<span class=S>-Yk0 &lt;1..7&gt; &lt;1..7&gt; &lt;col1&gt;..&lt;col2&gt;:</span>
Customize 'rainbow' colors.<br>
<span class=S>-Yk &lt;0..8&gt; &lt;0..8&gt; &lt;col1&gt;..&lt;col2&gt;:</span>
Customize 'general' colors.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can customize the colors as used for almost anything in the
program. A color may be set to any one of 16 values, represented by the numbers
0 to 15, which are: 0 - Black, 1 - Maroon, 2 - DkGreen, 3 - Orange, 4 - DkBlue,
5 - Purple, 6 - DkCyan, 7 - LtGray, 8 - Gray, 9 - Red, 10 - Green, 11 - Yellow,
12 - Blue, 13 - Magenta, 14 - Cyan, 15 - White. When entering a color as a
parameter, use the correct number above, or else type the colors name as
printed above (which may be abbreviated to the first three characters). The
switches to change color settings are below.</p>

<p class=B>-YkO &lt;obj1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt; &lt;colors&gt; switch: Colors of
planets and other objects can be set with this switch, which takes at least
three parameters. The first two parameters are the low and high object indexes
to change. The next parameters are the new colors for objects within that
range. If a color is Element (or the number 16), that means use the element
color of the sign the planet rules (which is the default color setting for the
main planets and house cusps). Note that the color Element will use either
standard, esoteric, or Hierarchical rulers, depending on the rulership
restrictions (as set with the -YR7 switch). If a color is Ray (or the number
17), that means use the color of the Ray associated with the planet. Note that
signs will use the colors of the house cusp objects corresponding to them, e.g.
the Pisces glyph and zodiac positions in Pisces will be printed in the color of
the 12th house cusp object.</p>

<p class=B>-YkC &lt;col1&gt; &lt;col2&gt; &lt;col3&gt; &lt;col4&gt; switch:
This switch defines the colors used for the four elements, and takes four
parameters, for fire, earth, air, and water, in that order. The colors used for
planets are based on the element of the sign they rule, so this affects the
colors of the main planets too. For example, to make earth be green and air
yellow, instead of the other way around as Astrolog used to always force, do -YkC
9 10 11 12 or -YkC Red Green Yellow Blue or just -YkC red gre yel blu.</p>

<p class=B>-YkA &lt;asp1&gt; &lt;asp2&gt; &lt;colors&gt; switch: This defines
the colors used for a range of aspects. The first two parameters are the lower
and upper indexes of the aspects to modify, and are followed by one color parameter
for each aspect in the range. For example, to highlight Trines by making them
white and all the other major aspects dark blue, do -YkA 1 5 dkb dkb dkb whi
dkb.</p>

<p class=B>-Yk7 &lt;val1&gt; &lt;val2&gt; &lt;colors&gt; switch: This defines
the colors of esoteric Rays. The first two parameters are the low and high Ray
numbers to change, ranging from 1 to 7. The next parameters are the new colors
for the Rays within that range.</p>

<p class=B>-Yk0 &lt;val1&gt; &lt;val2&gt; &lt;colors&gt; switch: This sets a
range of colors used other places in the program (excluding elements and
aspects) whose default colors are one of the colors of the rainbow. The first
two parameters are values from 1 to 7 indicating the lower and upper bounds of
the default colors to redefine, and are followed by new actual colors to use instead.
The seven indexes represent the colors Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue,
and Purple. For example, if you want to change the color used for the Uranians
from their default of purple to orange, do -Yk0 7 7 orange and you've
effectively redefined the color purple.</p>

<p class=B>-Yk &lt;val1&gt; &lt;val2&gt; &lt;colors&gt; switch: Like -Yk0 above
this also sets a range of colors as used many places in the program, except
this allows one to redefine all the standard or obscure colors (i.e. the other
nine that aren't one of the rainbow colors covered above). Again the first two
parameters indicate the range of colors to change which are from 0 to 8, and
are followed by the new colors to use. The nine indexes represent in order the
colors Black, White, LtGray, Gray, Maroon, DkGreen, DkCyan, DkBlue, and
Magenta. For example, to change the highlight color as used in graphics charts
to draw borders and the like from LtGray to Yellow, do -Yk 2 2 yellow. (Note
that you can use this to even change the colors Black and White to draw graphics
on whatever background color you want.)</p>

<p class=B>Note that colors can be specified as references to other colors, in
command switches taking color values as well as in dialog dropdowns in the
Windows version. For example, &quot;Fire&quot; (the current color of the element
Fire), &quot;Jupiter&quot; (Jupiters current color), &quot;Conjunction&quot;
(the aspects current color), and &quot;Ray3&quot; (that Rays current color)
all work. Color references can be abbreviated by the first three characters, or
however much is needed to be unique. Note that these are one time only input
translations to the current value of a particular color, and arent persistent
aliases that will update if the referenced color is later changed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YkU &lt;starlist&gt;:</span> Customize list of extra
star colors.</p>

<p class=B>This switch can be used to specify colors to use for particular
extra stars when the Show All Stars setting (-XU switch) is active. It takes
one parameter, which is a comma separated list of string pairs. These pairs
indicate the name of a star followed by the name of the color to use for it.
For example, -YkU
Alkaid,Red,Mizar,Blue,Alioth,Green,Megrez,Yellow,Dubhe,Orange,Merak,Magenta,Phecda,Purple
will highlight the seven stars of the Big Dipper in the seven Ray colors.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YkE &lt;astlist&gt;:</span> Customize list of extra
asteroid colors.</p>

<p class=B>This switch can be used to specify colors to use for particular
extra asteroids when the show asteroids setting (-XE switch) is active. It
takes one parameter, which is a comma separated list of string pairs. These
pairs indicate the numeric index of an asteroid followed by the name of the
color to use for it. For example, -YkE 5,Red,10,Blue will highlight asteroid
5 Astrea in red and 10 Hygiea in blue. You can also reference the name or
number+name of the asteroid, if the -XE switch is set appropriately so that
asteroids are being labeled in that format. For example, if -XE2 is in effect,
then -YkE Astraea,Red,Hygiea,Blue will also work.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YD &lt;obj&gt; &lt;name&gt;:</span> Customize display
name of object.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can change the name of objects, or what string is used to
display them in charts. The -YD command switch takes two parameters: The object
index to rename, and the string to use when displaying it. Object names must be
at least two characters long, and anything shorter will make the object revert
back to its default name. Note that renaming objects only changes how theyre
displayed in charts, which means command switches and such still need to refer
to the object by its default name.</p>

<p class=Section2>Switches to access obscure graphics options:</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXG &lt;0-2&gt;&lt;0-2&gt;&lt;0-3&gt;&lt;0-2&gt;:</span>
Select among different graphic glyphs for Capricorn, Uranus, Pluto, and Lilith.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog has the ability to choose between different common glyphs
for various astrological symbols. One may optionally display charts with the European
version of the Capricorn glyph, instead of the more twisty American type
glyph. One may display charts with the astronomical version of the Uranus
glyph using a dotted circle with an ascending arrow, instead of the more
astrological Herschel glyph with the crescent bounded cross over a circle.
One may display with the astronomical version of the Pluto glyph as the PL initials,
instead of the more astrological version with the circle over crescent over
cross. Finally one may choose to display Lilith as a small reversed crescent
instead of as a circle with a line through it. The -YXG switch changes the
glyphs to use for these signs and planets that may be drawn in more than one
way. It takes one parameter, a four digit number specifying the glyphs to use
for Capricorn (1000s place digit), Uranus (100s place), Pluto (10s place),
and Lilith (1s place). For each position, the digit 0 means to leave a glyph
alone, while 1 means set to whats generally considered the American form,
and 2 means to whats generally considered a European form. (For Pluto
only, one may also choose the digit 3, which is the upward pointing arrow
glyph used in Esoteric Astrology.) For example, -YXG 0120 leaves the glyphs
for Capricorn and Lilith at their present setting, sets Uranus to be the Herschel
glyph, and Pluto to be the astronomical P glyph. The default selection is 1111,
but astrologers in Europe may prefer 2222.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXD &lt;obj&gt; &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt;:</span>
Customize glyphs for planet.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog can change the glyphs used to display objects in graphics
charts. The -YXD switch takes three parameters: The object index to rename, and
two strings which contain the small and large definitions to use for the
objects glyph. The small definition measures 9x9 units (and is used when
drawing in the small 100% character scale), and the large definition measures
17x17 (and is used when drawing in the medium 200% character scale). If the
large definition is the empty string then a double scale version of the small
glyph will be used for it, and if the small definition is the empty string then
the default glyph for that object will be used. Glyphs are drawn in vector
format by moving a pen (similar to the draw command in the BASIC programming
language) and drawing starts from the middle unit coordinate. Strings consist
of a sequence of actions, each of which starts with a character indicating how
to move the pen, following by a number indicating how many units to move in
that direction (no number defaults to one unit).</p>

<p class=B>The action characters U, D, L, and R move up, down, left,
and right. Similarly, E, F, G, and H move 45 degrees up and to the
right, down and to the right, down and left, and up and left. The action prefix
B before one of the directions means blank, and moves the pen without
drawing a line while moving. The prefix N before one of the directions means
no update, and doesnt move the pen after drawing a line. For example, the
default small glyph for Jupiter is: BH3RFDGDGDR5NDNR2U6E. Special case: If a
definition consists of T then dont do any pen drawing at all, but instead
use the three letter text abbreviation of the object name for display, like is
done with fixed star objects.</p>

<p class=B>The -YXD switch (and -YXA below) take two parameters for the small
and large sized glyphs, which requires defining both. They can be invoked as -YXD1
and -YXA1 instead, which are simpler in that they take a single parameter for
the small glyph. (The large glyph will be the small glyph scaled appropriately.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXA &lt;asp&gt; &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt;:</span>
Customize glyphs for aspect.</p>

<p class=B>This switch changes the glyphs used to display aspects in graphics
charts. It takes three parameters: The aspect index to rename, and two strings
which contain the small and large definitions to use for the aspects glyph.
Aspect glyph definitions work the same as with the -YXD switch used to redefine
planet glyphs.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXv &lt;type&gt; [&lt;size&gt; [&lt;lines&gt;]]:</span>
Set wheel chart decoration.</p>

<p class=B>This switch specifies how to decorate the corners of wheel charts.
Parameter #1 is 0 for no decoration, 1 for a spider web pattern, or 2 for a
Moiré pattern. Parameter #2 is optional, and indicates how far along the edge
of the wheel chart the decoration extends, as a percentage from 1 to 100. For
example, if this is 50 then the patterns in each corner will just touch those
in adjacent corners. Note that values too high will impede display because
theyll start overlapping the wheel itself. Parameter #3 is also optional, and
indicates how many lines are used to compose the spider web pattern.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXg &lt;cells&gt;:</span> Set number of cells for
graphic aspect grid.</p>

<p class=B>This sets the size of the graphic -g aspect and midpoint grids, i.e.
the number of cell rows and columns available to draw items in. If this size
value is too high (or too many objects are restricted), there will be unused
rows at the bottom, while if its too low (or too many objects are added), rows
will be clipped off the bottom. If the grid size is set to zero, then the size
to use will be the number of unrestricted objects present, and the chart will
automatically resize as planets are (un)restricted.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXS &lt;au&gt;:</span> Set radius of graphic solar
system orbit chart.</p>

<p class=B>The graphic solar system orbit chart (-S -X switches) covers a given
amount of space measured in Astronomical Units (AU). Usually this size is
automatically determined by the glyph character scale setting (-Xs switch).
This switch allows one to specifically set the radius size in AU, which is
useful if one wants a wider or more focused view than the default. If this size
is 0, then the graphic orbit chart will be automatically sized as usual.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXj &lt;num&gt;:</span> Set number of graphic orbit
trails to remember.</p>

<p class=B>The graphic solar system orbit chart (-S -X switches) allows
remembering and displaying multiple locations of each planet. It allows
animating the chart over time, in which each planet has a trail behind it
showing its movement along its orbit. This switch determines how many positions
are remembered, and each new display of the chart in which planet locations are
different will append their locations to the current set of trails. The
locations are stored as coordinates in space relative to the central object,
which means the screen can be resized and the viewing scale changed and the
orbit trails will move accordingly, however actions like switching to or from
heliocentric will cause planets to appear to jump. Change this setting to 0 to
turn the feature off and remove the current set of trails.</p>

<p class=B>If the parameter is negative, the chart will instead draw complete
orbits for objects circling the Sun or Earth. These orbits will be circles of
the objects current radius in the plane of the ecliptic, so arent fully
accurate, but are still visually useful. Orbit circles will only be drawn for
objects whose transit restrictions are also unrestricted (-RT switch) which
allows specifying which objects you want to see orbits for.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXj0 &lt;step&gt;:</span> Set vertical step rate for
graphic orbit trails.</p>

<p class=B>Orbit trails in the graphic solar system orbit chart (-S -X
switches) are supported in the 3D wireframe file output, and the trails will be
connected lines instead of just dots in the wireframe scene. This switch allows
setting the vertical offset for each subsequent section of trail. The result
will be the orbit trails forming a helix instead of just a circle over time,
which allows interesting animation effects such as the entire solar system
appearing to move through space over time. For an example animation of this
type of wireframe file, see the video: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFhwfM0FKCo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFhwfM0FKCo</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YX7 &lt;inf&gt;:</span> Set influence width for
graphic esoteric ephemeris.</p>

<p class=B>This number specifies the width in influence units of each Rays
column in the esoteric graphic ephemeris. For example, given -YX7 600, then a
Ray influence value of 400 will fill 2/3 of the column.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXk:</span> Use more color for sign boundaries in
graphics charts.<br>
<span class=S>-YXk0:</span> Use more color for house boundaries in graphics
charts too.</p>

<p class=B>The -YXk switch will cause graphics charts to highlight zodiac sign
boundaries in extra color. For example, wheel charts, solar system orbit
charts, and the graphic ephemeris will have sign boundaries drawn in the color
of each sign instead of always in grayscale. This also influences the display
of chart spheres, and local horizon charts when 3D houses are on. If the switch
is invoked as -YXk0 instead, then the 12 houses will be highlighted in extra
color as well. Some may find the extra coloring makes charts stand out more,
while others may find it to be too much and actually make charts harder to
read.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXK &lt;col&gt; &lt;rgb&gt;:</span> Customize RGB
value of color index.</p>

<p class=B>This switch can be used to redefine the actual colors within
Astrologs default color palette. It takes two parameters, the name of the
color to redefine, and the new RGB color value to use for that color index. The
RGB color value can either be a three comma separated decimal numbers, or the
# character followed by three two character hexadecimal numbers in sequence.
For example, -YXK Orange 255,127,0 or -YXK Orange #ff7f00 will change the color
Orange from the dark yellow thats the default to an actual fiery orange
color.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXe:</span> Align certain charts to plane of ecliptic.</p>

<p class=B>Astrologs chart sphere and local horizon charts use the local
horizon for its equator, while Astrologs globe charts are aligned with the
Earths equator. Using this switch, these charts will be tilted so theyre
aligned with the ecliptic instead. When in this mode, rotating and tilting the
globe will do so relative to the plane of the ecliptic.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXa &lt;num&gt;:</span> Set limit to dashedness in
aspect lines drawn.</p>

<p class=B>In graphics charts, dashed lines are used when drawing aspect lines
whose orbs arent exact, with more space between points indicating a wider orb.
This switch indicates the maximum number of pixels allowed to be skipped between
set pixels. Limits are useful to prevent very wide orbs from being hard to see.
Images such as <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/orbit2.png">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/orbit2.png</a>
(which compares Earths to Venus orbit over time) are generated by having 360
degree orbs, or always drawing a line between two planets (and never with any
dashedness in them, so -YXa 0 is used).</p>

<p class=B>If the parameter is negative, then that modifies aspect lines so
that exact aspects are drawn solid, and aspects at the orb limit for the aspect
in question are drawn with &lt;num&gt; spaces between points. This may be
preferred to the default behavior in which the dashedness of the line is only
based on the number of degrees the aspect is different from exact. The default
behavior will result in aspects to the North Node (which by default only allows
a two degree orb to it) to always be nearly solid, even if the aspect is near
the orb limit for being shown at all. The Modify Display command (-Xi switch)
will toggle between these two display modes (i.e. it negates the value of the
-YXa switch).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXU &lt;starlist&gt; &lt;linklist&gt;:</span> Define
lines between extra stars.</p>

<p class=B>When the extra stars shown by the Show All Stars setting (-XU
switch) are drawn, lines can be drawn between certain pairs of stars. The -YXU
switch will define what stars to draw lines between. It takes two parameters, a
comma separated list of strings indicating stars that may have lines connected
to them, and a comma separated list of number pairs indicating indexes of stars
within the list of strings to connect. For example, -YXU
Alkaid,Mizar,Alioth,Megrez,Phecda,Merak,Dubhe 0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6 will
draw lines among the seven stars of the Big Dipper. The second parameter
usually has number indexes separated with commas, however a semicolon will
treat subsequent numbers as starting one beyond the highest number seen so far.
That allows defining separate constellations without having to keep track of
continually increasing index numbers.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXf &lt;0-4&gt;&lt;0-1&gt;&lt;0-3&gt;&lt;0-3&gt;:</span>
Set usage of fonts in graphic charts.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog supports five different fonts for display of signs, houses,
planets, and aspects. They are Astrologs default internal vector drawing, the
Wingdings font from Windows (for signs only), the Astro font by Kenneth Hirst,
the EnigmaAstrology font by Jan Kampherbeek, and generic high Unicode
characters. The -YXf switch takes a four digit number, which indicates which
font to use for each area, in which 0=Astrolog, 1=Wingdings, 2=Astro, 3=Enigma,
4=Unicode. For example, the default when the use real system fonts in graphics
charts setting in the Display Settings dialog is turned on is 1022, which
means Wingdings for signs, Astrolog for houses, and Astro for objects and
aspects. In the Windows version, the Graphics Settings dialog has new radio
button groups so one can select exactly which font they want to use for each
area. For PostScript and Windows metafile graphics files, zero means no system
fonts, while non-zero means use Courier and the Astro font, and Wingdings for
metafiles.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXp &lt;-1,0,1&gt;:</span> Set paper orientation for
PostScript files.</p>

<p class=B>This allows one to set the page orientation for full PostScript
graphics files as generated with the -Xp0 switch. If the orientation parameter
value is positive, that means the chart will be printed in portrait mode, while
if negative, it will be in landscape mode. If the orientation value is set to
zero (the default), then the program will decide based on the size of the
current chart, with charts with wider horizontal sizes (e.g. astro-graph charts
and wheel charts with sidebars) being in landscape, and charts with horizontal
sizes less than or equal to the vertical (e.g. aspect grids and wheel charts
without sidebars) being in portrait.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YXp0 &lt;hor&gt; &lt;ver&gt;:</span> Set paper size for
PostScript files.</p>

<p class=B>One may also choose the paper size of full -Xp0 PostScript graphics
charts. There are two parameters given which specify the horizontal and
vertical size of the paper to be printed upon. By default this is 8.5&quot; x
11&quot;. If you have say 8.5&quot; x 14&quot; legal size or A4 paper in your
printer it can be used just as easily. Sizes may be specified in inches or
centimeters. If the parameter ends in cm then it will be parsed as
centimeters, and if it ends in in then it will be parsed as inches. If
theres no units, then it will be parsed based on the -Yv metric switch
setting.</p>

<p class=Section2>Switches to access obscure system options:</p>

<p class=N><span class=S>-YB:</span> Make a beep sound at the time this switch
is processed.</p>

<p class=B>This obscure switch just sounds a generic system beep.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YY &lt;rows&gt;:</span> Load atlas list of city
locations from current file.</p>

<p class=B>Astrologs atlas information is stored in the file atlas.as, which
gets loaded the first time atlas information is needed. This is an Astrolog
command switch text file like any other, and can easily be user modified or
extended. The header of the file describes the format. The file consists of one
instance of the new -YY command switch, which takes one parameter indicating
the number of city location lines that follow in the file. (If you add or
delete cities from the file, make sure to also update this number
appropriately.) This switch is only valid in switch files, and an error will be
displayed if its seen on the command line.</p>

<p class=B>The default atlas.as file contains over 24,000 cities, or every city
in the world with over 15,000 population. Similar to ephemeris files, you can
download a larger atlas if you want more cities available. The file <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/atlas/atlasbig.as">http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/atlas/atlasbig.as</a>
contains nearly 200,000 cities, or every city in the world with over 500
population. You can replace the default atlas.as with atlasbig.as, or just load
the larger file into the program when needed. The information in these atlases
was composed using data from <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">https://www.geonames.org/</a>,
available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YY1 &lt;rules&gt; &lt;entries&gt;:</span> Load
Daylight Time rules from current file.</p>

<p class=B>Astrologs time zone change information is stored in the file timezone.as,
which gets loaded the first time that such information is needed. This
information was converted from version 2020a of the collaborative open source
and public domain TZ database (sometimes called the Olson database) at <a
href="https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html">https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html</a>,
which is used by many programs and operating systems for time zone and Daylight
Saving Time determination. This database is fully accurate everywhere in the
world for 1970 and beyond. Before 1970 time changes are often an inexact
science, but are estimated to be at least 90% accurate. The file timezone.as is
an Astrolog command switch text file like any other, and can be user modified.
The sections within the file describe the format. There are three sections in
it, which contain instances of the -YY1, -YY2, and -YY3 switches.</p>

<p class=B>The -YY1 switch reads in a new set of Daylight Saving Time change
rules from the current switch file, consisting of the specified number of rules,
each consisting of a sublist of rule entries. First parameter is number of
rules, and second is the total number of rule entry lines in all rules. The
time zone areas read in by the -YY2 switch can specify different rules to apply
at different times.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YY2 &lt;zones&gt; &lt;entries&gt;:</span> Load time
zone change lists from file.</p>

<p class=B>This switch reads in a new set of time zone changes from the current
switch file, consisting of the specified number of time zone areas, each
consisting of a sublist of zone change entries. First parameter is number of
time zone areas, and second is the total number of zone change entry lines in
all areas. This defines when time zone offsets themselves change in a
particular area, as well as when to apply or not apply Daylight Saving Time
rules.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-YY3 &lt;rows&gt;:</span> Load atlas time zone to zone
change mappings from file.</p>

<p class=B>This switch reads in a new set of time zone links from the current
switch file, consisting of the specified number of time zones (as specified by
the -YY switch) and how each maps to a zone change area as specified by the
-YY2 switch. This defines how a citys time zone maps to a time zone area, so
the program can lookup a date/time in question within that area to see the time
zone and Daylight Time offsets that were in effect then.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-0[o,i,q,X,~]:</span> Permanently disable file output,
file input, program exiting, all graphics, or AstroExpressions.</p>

<p class=B>This obscure switch is invoked in one of five forms: -0o, -0i, -0q,
-0X, or -0~, and more than one of the subswitches may be combined, e.g. -0oiqX~
to do all five forms at once. Each subswitch disables a section of the program.
The five areas of file output, file input, program termination, graphics mode
charts, and AstroExpression processing, may be respectively turned off by the five
subswitches above. Once a section is disabled, it is that way permanently and
can not be turned back on until the program quits. Attempting to access a
restricted feature will display an appropriate error message or at least do
nothing.</p>

<p class=B>This switch was meant to be used when Astrolog is being run from a
chart server, as a demo, or related situation. For example, if one set up
Astrolog on a network to be able to receive chart requests including arbitrary
command lines where the result is e-mailed back to the user, the administrator
probably wants to prevent the client from using the -o switch to create or
potentially overwrite files on the server, in which case -0o can be put in the
astrolog.as file to prevent file output before the client gets a chance to do
anything. Similarly, -0i can be used to prevent the client from using -i to
read in private files on the server. If the server only e-mails text back to
the user, you probably don't want the server copy of the program going into
interactive graphics mode waiting for someone to pass it keystrokes, in which
case -0X can be used. Finally, -0q might be useful in demo situations where
people can play with the program but you don't want them exiting it. In this
last case, the only way to stop the program is to kill the process (although a
Control-C should stop command line or Unix versions).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-;:</span> Ignore rest of command line and treat it as
a comment.</p>

<p class=B>The -; dash semicolon switch when encountered causes all the rest
of the switches on a command line to be ignored and not processed. This allows
the semicolon (usually used by itself without the optional dash prefix of
course) to be used to begin comments and for comment lines in the various
command files.</p>

<p class=Section2>Astrolog graphics screen key press options (version 7.10):</p>

<p class=B>(Note: When a graphics chart is up, pressing a key which doesn't do
any of the operations below will sound a beep.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'H' or '?'</span> to display this list of key
options.</p>

<p class=B>Pressing this will display a help list of all the key presses
available in the text screen from which the window was invoked from.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'p'</span> to toggle pause status on or off.</p>

<p class=B>Press this to pause all automatic updates to the window or screen.
This is mainly used to temporarily freeze any animation so a particular chart
can be looked at without interruption. When animation is on but temporarily
paused with this key, the mouse (inactive for the purpose of scribbling during
animation) will come active again. Related to this, the number keys which set
the rate of animation, but for PCs scroll the chart when not in animation
mode, will do the scrolling instead of setting the rate when animation is
paused then.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'x'</span> to toggle foreground/background colors
on screen.</p>

<p class=B>Pressing this will invert the colors on the screen, or in other
words will do the same thing as the -Xr switch on the command line.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'm'</span> to toggle color/monochrome display on
screen.</p>

<p class=B>For color displays, pressing this key will toggle in and out of
monochrome mode.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'i'</span> to toggle status of the minor chart
modification.</p>

<p class=B>Pressing this key will toggle whether or not an alternate form of
the present chart should be displayed. See the -Xi switch described earlier for
more information on these alternate chart formats.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 't'</span> to toggle header info on current
chart on screen.</p>

<p class=B>Pressing the 't' key will toggle whether or not the chart parameters
are printed at the bottom of the window or in a sidebar. This corresponds to
the -Xt switch mentioned earlier.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'b'</span> to toggle drawing of a border around
the chart.</p>

<p class=B>This key, when pressed when a graphics chart is being displayed,
will toggle whether or not a border is drawn around the graphic. Some charts,
such as aspect grids, will always have a border regardless of the state of this
flag, while others such as the globes will never have one. Most charts however,
such as the wheel charts will look good either way and this key can be used to
choose.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'l'</span> to toggle labeling of object points
in chart.</p>

<p class=B>Press the 'l' key in a window to inhibit the labeling of all planets
in the various charts. Instead of drawing the actual little point and then the
glyph near it (as well as sometimes a line from the glyph to the dot), just the
point is displayed. This mode is mainly useful for the -Z horizon and -S space
charts (and has little use for anything else) when in cramped quarters or to
get a more realistic view of how the sky actually looks.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'k'</span> to toggle labeling of glyphs on
aspect lines.</p>

<p class=B>Press the 'k' key to toggle whether or not aspect lines between
planets in charts are labeled with the aspects glyph over the middle of the
line. This will do the same thing as the -XA switch.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'j'</span> to toggle not clearing screen between
chart updates.</p>

<p class=B>This key toggles on the jet trails / time exposure flag which will
cause the graphics screen to not be cleared on new chart draws. See the -Xj
switch which affects the same setting for more info.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'v'</span> to display current chart positions on
text screen.</p>

<p class=B>Press this key to dump back to the text screen the list of where all
the planets currently being displayed in the window are. This display is the
same as produced with the -v switch, and is useful if one wants text to show
where everything in the chart is.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'R', 'C', 'u', 'U'</span> to toggle restriction
status of minor objects, minor house cusps, Uranian planets, and stars.</p>

<p class=B>Press the 'R' (restrict) key in an Astrolog graphics screen and the
chart will be redrawn with the restriction status of the asteroids and other
minor objects toggled. Pressing the 'C', 'u', and 'U' keys in the window will
toggle the restriction status of the four minor house cusps, the Uranian
planets, and the fixed stars, respectively. These keys compliment the 'R' key
option and are the counterparts to the -C, -u, -U, and -RC, -Ru, -RU switches.
(Note that for the 'C', 'u', and 'U' keys, toggling their state off will
automatically restrict all the objects associated with them, while the 'R' key
can simultaneously restrict some and unrestrict other bodies.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'c'</span> to toggle relationship comparison
chart mode.</p>

<p class=B>This key, when pressed when a graphics chart is being displayed,
will toggle the state of whether a relationship comparison chart (-r0) is being
shown. For example, pressing it when a wheel chart is up will revert to a dual
wheel chart showing two sets of planets, while pressing it when an aspect grid
is up will revert to a dual aspect grid between the planets of two different
charts. When going from a comparison to a single chart, one of the charts will
be used while the other thrown away. When going from a single to a comparison,
the same chart information will be put in both (which won't be too useful until
they are made different through animation or other keypresses).</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 's', 'h', 'a', 'f', 'g', 'z', 'y'</span> to
toggle status of sidereal zodiac, heliocentric charts, 3D houses, domal charts,
decan charts, vedic format wheel charts, and navamsa charts.</p>

<p class=B>Press the 's' key in the window to toggle whether or not the
sidereal vs. tropical zodiac is used. Press the 'h' key to toggle to a
heliocentric based chart or back again to a geocentric one. Press the 'a' key
to toggle whether house placements take 3D latitude into account instead of
just zodiac longitude. Press the 'f' key to toggle the status of whether or not
the chart should be modified to correspond to the appropriate domal chart
(where the house positions are represented as zodiac positions and vice versa).
Press the 'g' key to toggle the status of whether or not the chart should be
modified to correspond to a decan chart (where each sign is divided in thirds
representing the two other signs in its element). Press the 'z' key to toggle
whether wheel charts are displayed in Vedic format. Press the 'y' key to toggle
whether charts are displayed in navamsa format or not. These keys of course
correspond the -s, -h, -c3, -f, -3, -J, and -9 options, respectively.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'O' and 'o'</span> to recall/store a previous
chart from memory.</p>

<p class=B>Have you ever animated your natal or some other chart to some far
distant future or past time, only then to wish you could somehow easily get
back in time to the original chart? You can, by pressing the 'O' key in a
window, which will recall to the screen previously saved chart parameters
(which are by default set to whatever you started the window with.) Press the
'o' key to change this default stored chart to be the chart that is presently
in the window.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'B'</span> to dump current window contents to
root background.</p>

<p class=B>Press the 'B' key in an X window to dump whatever is currently being
displayed to the background root window. This is basically the corresponding
keypress to the -XB option.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'B'</span> to resize chart display to full size
of screen.</p>

<p class=B>For PC systems, the 'B' key does a different function that the
feature shown above. See PC graphics section for its description.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'Q'</span> to resize chart display to a square.</p>

<p class=B>One can manually resize the Astrolog X Windows using a window
manager (except when a world map or aspect grid is displayed, in which case any
resizing will have no effect). Pressing the 'Q' key will automatically resize
any (non-world map) window to be a square. This is useful, after resizing
charts to approximately the size you want, to make them precise squares. Note
that for PCs, this will take EGA and CGA mode pixel ratios into account, in
that the horizontal and vertical sizes may be made different in order that the
actual display looks square. This will also take into account wheel chart
sidebars and only resize the actual visible chart to a square when one is being
displayed to prevent distortion.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press '&lt;' and '&gt;'</span> to decrease/increase
the scale size of the glyphs and the size of world map.</p>

<p class=B>This two keys will respectively decrease and increase the size of
the sign and planet glyphs (as well as resize the astro-graph and aspect grid
charts) through the three scale factors available. After resizing the window,
you will probably want to use these keys if the glyphs are then too big or
small for the new chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press '[' and ']'</span> to decrease/increase tilt in
globe display.</p>

<p class=B>'[', ']' keys: Not only can the globe display be rotated, but the
poles can be tilted down at various angles! Press the '[' and ']' keys when the
globe is being displayed to respectively pull down and push back up the
angle of the polar axis from which the globe is viewed. Combining this with the
globe rotation allows one to move any point of the globe to the center of the
screen.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press '+' and '-'</span> to add/subtract a day from
current chart.</p>

<p class=B>These keys, when pressed when a graphics chart is being displayed,
will update the current chart forward or backward one day (actually 1..9 days
based on the current animation rate). When animation mode itself is active,
these keys will jump by the current animation step, instead of only an amount
in days.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'n'</span> to set chart information to current
time now.</p>

<p class=B>This key, when pressed when a graphics chart is being displayed,
will change the current chart (or outer chart when a -r0 comparison chart is
up) to the current time and place now. This interactively does the same as the
-n command line switch. The only other way to revert a graphics chart to the
time now is to enter animation mode via the 'N' key and then leave it, so
this is a shortcut convenience. (This feature is only available when the TIME
compile time value is uncommented of course.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'N'</span> to toggle animation status on or off.
Charts will be updated to current status and globe will rotate.</p>

<p class=B>Animation: This key will toggle in and out of a mode where the chart
is continually updated in the window. Entering the animation mode will cause
the chart being currently displayed to be replaced by the chart for the exact
moment at the time you are running the program. Every second or two, the chart
will be updated to reflect the new current state of the planets and houses. For
large window sizes, one can actually see very minor changes in the chart every
few seconds. With the text 'T' mode in effect, the chart is basically an
advanced version of xclock, and makes a good window to be left running on your
display. If you are in the -XG globe display mode, pressing the 'N' key will
cause the globe to rotate for an impressive display! Note that when a
comparison relationship chart is up, animation will forward the chart in the second
slot rather than the first. This is more intuitive when animating bi-wheel
transit to natal charts, where the transiting, i.e. second, chart will be the
one forwarded.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press '!'-'('</span> to begin updating current chart
by adding times. !: seconds, @: minutes, #: hours, $: days, : months, ^: years,
&amp;: years*10, *: years*100, (: years*1000.</p>

<p class=B>These nine keys (i.e. shift plus the number keys from 1..9) enter
into a different form of chart animation. Pressing them will cause the current
chart being displayed (i.e. it will not revert to the current planet positions)
to continually have a delta time added to it and be recast and shown. Pressing
'!' will have one second added to the chart for every update (slow action
unless you have a very fast system - the animation will be even slower than for
the 'N' key). Pressing '@' will have one minute added to the chart each time,
which makes for a nice display (note that you will definitely want to be in the
text 'T' mode for these animations so you can see what times in the future
these charts are being cast for. Pressing '#' will have one hour added each
time (note that now the house cusps are starting to move quickly, so you may
want to switch to a different system of houses (such as the Equal to keep the
Midheaven from flopping back and forth) and/or use -1 to put an object like the
sun on the Ascendant.) Pressing '$' will have one day added each time (now you will
probably want to start using -R to remove fast moving objects like the moon),
and pressing '%' will have one month added for each update of the window. The
final keys, shift 6..9 cause years, decades, centuries, and millennia to be
added each time, and tend to only be used to look for long range actions (such
as when will Neptune next enter Pisces). To exit these animation modes, press
the 'N' key.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'r'</span> to reverse direction of time-lapse or
animation.</p>

<p class=B>Press this to reverse the direction of any animation taking place.
For the '!'..'(' animation keys above, this will cause negative times to be
added to the chart, e.g. pressing '#' then 'r' on a chart cast for noon will
cause the next chart to be displayed for 11am, then 10am, etc. For the Globe
animation, this will cause the rotation to reverse direction.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press '1'-'9'</span> to set rate of animation to 'n'
degrees, etc.</p>

<p class=B>The nine number keys are used to set the relative rate of
animation to n units. For example, normally the @ key means add one minute to
the chart for each update, but press 5 and now we are adding 5 minutes each
time. For the Globe animation, by default the Earth rotates one degree each
time; however, the number keys can speed this up to nine degrees for each
update.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'V','A','Z','S','M','K','J','L','E','X','W','G','P'</span>
to switch to normal (-v), grid (-g), local (-Z), space (-S), sector (-l),
calendar (-K), dispositor (-j), astro-graph (-L), ephemeris (-E), sphere (-XX),
world map (-XW), globe (-XG), polar (-XP) modes.</p>

<p class=B>There are basically 13 main modes in which the graphics screen can
be in: There are the nine main charts (wheel, aspect grid, local sky, space
view, Gauquelin sector, calendar, dispositor, astro-graph, and ephemeris) as
well as the four map displays (the chart sphere, the simple world map by
itself, the globe view, and the polar projection). These 13 keys can be used to
switch between these modes in the middle of program execution. For example, you
can bring up your own chart in a window, then press 'L' to see the astro-graph
chart for the same birth data. Then you can press 'W' to just see the world map
by itself, and 'G' to see the globe view, after which you can press 'V' to
return to your original wheel chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press '0'</span> to toggle between -Z,-Z0 &amp;
-XW,-XW0 &amp; -E,-Ey modes.</p>

<p class=B>When graphics are up on the screen, pressing this key acts similar
to the mode changing keys above that switch between the different graphic chart
types. When pressed, the state of the program being invoked with -Z vs. -Z0, as
well as the state of -XW vs. -XW0, and the state of -E vs. -Ey, will be
reversed. In other words, if I am viewing the -Z -X horizon chart, and I want
to see the -Z0 -X sky graphic, then I press '0' to go to it. Similarly, this
key will flip me back and forth between the -XW simple rectangular world map
display and the -XW0 Mollewide projection graphic, as well as the -E monthly
ephemeris and the -Ey yearly ephemeris. This is a quick way to change these
suboptions while the program is running.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'F'</span> to toggle between world and
constellation map modes.</p>

<p class=B>This key toggles on the constellation charts where the map and globe
modes show the celestial sphere instead of the Earths continents. See the -XF
switch which affects the same setting for complete info.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'e'</span> to toggle display of Earth's equator
in map modes.</p>

<p class=B>This key toggles whether the Earths equator is drawn on the local
horizon, chart sphere, globe, and map displays. See the -Xe switch which
affects the same setting for complete info.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'd'</span> to toggle display of house
information in map modes.</p>

<p class=B>This key toggles whether house cusp boundaries are drawn on the
local horizon, chart sphere, globe, and map displays. See the -XC switch which
affects the same setting for complete info.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'F1'-'F12'</span> [plus Shift,Ctrl,Alt] to run
macros 1-48.</p>

<p class=B>For PCs, pressing the function keys F1 through F12 will execute
macros when graphics are being displayed. Pressing F1 through F12 will run
macros 1 through 12. Pressing Shift+F1 through Shift+F12 will run macros 13
through 24. Control+F1 through Control+F12 will run macros 25 through 36.
Finally Alt+F1 through Alt+F12 will run macros 37 through 48. Executing a macro
that hasn't been defined yet (either with a function key or the -M switch) will
do nothing.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'space'</span> to force update of current
graphics display.</p>

<p class=B>When a graphics chart is up on the screen, pressing the space bar
will force a redraw of the chart. This is useful for say to cleanup after one
has scribbled on it with the mouse button features (described below).</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'del'</span> to clear the graphics screen and
not redraw.</p>

<p class=B>Pressing the delete key when a graphics screen is up will clear the
screen, but not redraw the chart right away unless animation mode is on. This
is most useful for the -Xj timed exposure streaks in horizon and orbit charts
if you want to start a new jet trail while animating.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'enter'</span> to input a command line of
general switches.</p>

<p class=B>Pressing the return key when a graphics screen is up will pause and
prompt you for a command line. This command line will be processed after which
you will be returned back to the graphics state you left, allowing the changing
on the fly of any setting that isn't already covered by pressing whatever key,
without having to drop all the way back to a -Q loop or out of the program altogether.
This can be used to redisplay the -H switch help list too. (There are a couple
of rare things you can't do in the middle of graphics, e.g. you aren't allowed
to suddenly switch to one of the graphics file modes.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Press 'q'</span> to terminate the window and program.</p>

<p class=B>Pressing this key will close the window, and also exit the Astrolog
program itself.</p>

<p class=A>--</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Left mouse button:</span> Draw line strokes on chart
in window.<br>
<span class=K>Middle mouse button:</span> Print coordinates of pointer on world
map.<br>
<span class=K>Right mouse button:</span> Terminate the window and program.</p>

<p class=B>Clicking mouse buttons within the window (of the X Windows or MS
Windows version) will do various functions. The left mouse button acts as a pen
that allows one to actually draw on the chart: Click it and drag the pointer to
draw a line on the window, which is good for aiding in analysis or in
presentations. (Any scribbles one makes will disappear the next time the chart
window is updated.) The middle mouse button (or Alt+left click in the MS
Windows version) will only work when a world map is shown, i.e. in the -L
astro-graph or -XW world map displays: Click to get the approximate longitude
and latitude of the place on the map where the pointer is, printed in the main
window (or have the current charts location set to this location in the MS
Windows version). For the four scale sizes of 100, 200, 300, and 400 percent,
the accuracy is to the nearest degree, 30 minutes, 20', and 15', respectively.
So, if you want to cast a chart for southern Madagascar, Africa, but don't know
the coordinates, click the middle button on the map for a good approximation!
Finally, the right button (middle button if any for PCs) acts just like the
'q' key, and will terminate the program.</p>

<p class=B>Note that for X Windows, pressing the middle mouse button when a
world map is up, in addition to displaying the longitude and latitude of the
point clicked on in the parent window, will also set the current chart location
to this point. This makes an easy interface for doing chart relocation! Say you
want to relocate your natal chart to Tokyo, Japan. Just bring up your chart in
graphics mode, press 'W' to switch to the world map display, click middle
button on Japan, then return to the wheel chart and there your chart is, as if
you had been born at the same time but in Tokyo.</p>

<p class=A><span class=K>Control keys:</span> Certain control keys can be
pressed when a graphics chart is up to set the color of the pen one can
scribble on the chart with using the left mouse button. (Who knows, maybe
Astrolog will contain a full featured drawing program someday. ;) Usually, the
scribbles are always in the gray highlight color. However, sixteen control keys
can be pressed to change the pen to sixteen different colors, which are defined
as follows: Ctrl-A is White, Ctrl-Z is Black, Ctrl-R is Red, Ctrl-G is Green,
Ctrl-B is Blue, Ctrl-Y is Yellow, Ctrl-O is Orange, Ctrl-L is Light gray,
Ctrl-D is Dark gray, Ctrl-V is Magenta (Valentine pink), Ctrl-U is Purple
(pUrple), Ctrl-E is Maroon (Dark red, next to 'R' on keyboard), Ctrl-F is Dark
Green (Forest green, next to 'G' on keyboard), Ctrl-N is Dark Blue (Navy blue,
next to 'B' on keyboard), Ctrl-J is Cyan, Ctrl-K is Dark Cyan (Next to 'J' on
keyboard).</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=main>DATA ENTRY AND THE MAIN DISPLAY</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>The main part of the program is executed simply by entering astrolog
(assuming thats the name of the executable), and the program will ask you for
all the birth info and will give the planet/house positions. For example, for a
chart in Seattle at the Summer Solstice (for June 20th, 2020 CE/AD at 2:44pm
Pacific Daylight Time, 7 hours before UTC) for the ten prompts one would enter:
Jun, 20, 2020, 2:44pm, Y, PT, 122W20, 47N36, Summer Solstice, Seattle WA. The
program then calculates and displays the positions of all planets, Chiron, the
four main asteroids, as well as items like North Node and South Node of the
Moon, Lilith, the Part of Fortune, the Vertex, and the East Point. Uranian
bodies and fixed stars can also be listed if one includes the appropriate
command switches.</p>

<p class=A>Two of the chart info fields interactively prompted for above are
general text fields for the persons name or chart title, and the name of the
city or location the chart is cast for. After you enter the location, if it
matches a city in the atlas, the recommended values to enter for Daylight Time,
time zone, and longitude/latitude will be displayed. When set, the contents of
these fields will be displayed in the various charts, such as the -v listing,
the -w text wheel, and in the graphic wheel chart sidebars.</p>

<p class=A>Another field explicitly prompted for is whether Daylight Saving
time was in effect for the chart or not. (Without this one would have to
subtract one hour from the time or time zone to indicate if Daylight time was
in effect, which of course was limited in that its not always clear whether a
given chart was for say 11am Standard time, or really for noon Daylight time.)
Enter 0, Y, or S for Standard time, and 1, N, or D for Daylight
time (or War time). An indication of Standard or Daylight time will be shown in
the headers of the -v listing and in the graphics charts.</p>

<p class=A>--</p>

<p class=A>The user interface where one manually inputs the chart information
is smart in various ways, as many of the chart info fields may be entered in
several formats and be parsed correctly:</p>

<p class=A>Months may be entered as numbers from 1 to 12 or as their true
names. Case doesn't matter, and month names may be abbreviated to their first
three letters.</p>

<p class=A>Year values may be entered with an optional BCE/BC or CE/AD suffix.
(Periods may be interspersed, e.g. b.c. is allowed.) Years BCE/BC may also be
entered as negative years, but if you do this note that you have to add one to
the negative number since theres no formal year 0 BCE/BC or 0 CE/AD, e.g.
since 1BCE/BC is followed by 1CE/AD, specifying 5BC would be the number -4.</p>

<p class=A>Astrolog deals with the switchover from the Julian to the present
Gregorian calendar system when accepting input and printing output. The
calendar system changed (at least in most of Europe) from the Julian to the
Gregorian calendar in 1582 when October 4th was followed the next day by
October 15th. Throughout the program Astrolog uses the Julian Calendar for date
and leap year specification for dates before 10/4/1582 (date modifiable with
the -ig switch) and the Gregorian after. It will properly handle the change
even in the middle of months in charts, e.g. in -K calendar charts, -E
ephemeris charts, -dm aspect search charts, and graphics animations, ten days
will be skipped in October 1582.</p>

<p class=A>Time values may be entered with a pm or am (or just p and a)
suffix (periods may be interspersed), or in the standard 24 hour clock. The
separator between hours and minutes should be a colon. For example, 6:30pm may
be entered as 18:30 or 6:30p. 12:30am may be entered as 12:30a.m., 0:30,
and so on. Time values will also parse seconds. For example, 12:34:56am translates
to 12 hours, 34 minutes, and 56 seconds. Fractional seconds can be entered,
e.g. 12:34:56.78 means 12 hours, 34 minutes, and 56.78 seconds. One can still
enter times like 12:34pm without a seconds qualifier, in which case 0 seconds
will be used. Fractional hours and minutes may also be entered. For example,
12:30pm is the same as 12.5, and 12:30.4pm is the same as 12:30:24.</p>

<p class=A>Time zones may be entered as hours away from UTC. Positive numbers indicate west or before UTC, and negative numbers indicate east or after UTC. Numbers may
also be terminated with W or E to indicate west or east or UTC. Time zones
may also be abbreviation strings, such as EST, PST, and UTC. Note that
this setting is still separate from the Daylight Time setting. In other words,
strings such as EDT or EWT may be entered, but that will only subtract one
hour from the time zone number, and not turn on or off the Daylight setting.
Hence it may be preferred to enter strings that don't imply such an assumption,
i.e. Astrolog also accepts general abbreviations such as ET or PT. For that
matter, some one letter time zone abbreviations are accepted, e.g. E or P for
Eastern and Pacific. When specifying half hour time zones as a number instead
of using an abbreviation, the correct way is with :30 or .5, since the
parameter is processed as hours and minutes. Below is a table of all zone
abbreviations Astrolog accepts. Listed for each zone is its official name, its
standard abbreviation, its hours before UTC, and its standard meridian. For
some zones the program accepts special two and one letter shortcuts:</p>

<p class=A>Note: The special time zone setting LMT allows one to do charts
for times given in Local Mean Time. When encountered, the actual time zone
setting will be set just so, doing the subtract four minutes for every degree
west of the time zones standard meridian arithmetic, to make it work.</p>

<p class=A>Longitude and latitude locations may be entered in the standard
&lt;degree&gt;&lt;direction&gt;&lt;minute&gt; notation, e.g. 122W20 or 33S52.
The direction specifier may also be put at the end of the string, with a period
or colon separator between degrees and minutes, e.g. 122:20W or 33.52S. The
direction character may also be left off altogether in which case positive
values indicate western and northern locations and negative eastern and
southern, e.g. 122.20 or -33:52. Seconds can also be entered for longitude
and latitude locations, in formats such as 122W19:59 or 122:19:59W.</p>

<p class=A>Note: When parsing time zones, the number can be preceded by the
letter H, e.g. h5w is the same as 5w. Also, for times and locations,
seconds can be specified by having four digits in a row after the degree/hour,
e.g. 12:3456 is equivalent to 12:34:56. These are formats used by
Astrodienst on astro.com, which its good to be able to parse.</p>

<p class=A>--</p>

<p class=A>When the chart zodiac positions are displayed, by default theyre
truncated instead of rounded, e.g. a position of 12Lib34 means the actual
position is somewhere between 12Lib34:00 and 12Lib34:59. When the standard list
of planetary positions is displayed, some additional pieces of information are
shown along with the planetary locations: Whether or not each planet is in its
ruling sign, or detriment, as well as the same information for houses, is
shown. Planets in their exalted and fall i.e. debilitated signs and houses are
noted too. In addition to the (R) indicating a planet in its ruling sign, and
an (d) for a planet in detriment, we have (X) if a planet is in its exalting
sign, and a (f) for a planet in its fall sign (which is always opposite the
exaltation, as how the detriment is opposite the ruler). </p>

<p class=A>The text listing also indicates Esoteric Astrology rulerships.
Normally shown is whether the planet exoterically rules or is debilitated in
the sign (indicated with R or d characters), and whether the planet exalts
or falls in the sign (X or f characters). If the right rulership
restrictions are set, also included is whether the planet esoterically rules or
is debilitated in the sign (S or s characters), whether the planet
Hierarchically rules or is debilitated in the sign (H or h characters), and
whether the planet Ray rules or is Ray debilitated in the sign i.e. whether the
planets Ray is the same as one of the signs Rays (Y or z characters). In
case of multiple alignments applying, the order of priority is to show a
standard exoteric rulership or debilitation, an exaltation or fall, an esoteric
rulership, a Hierarchical rulership, and finally a Ray rulership.</p>

<p class=A>In this main display, an element table indicating the sum of the
signs in each element and mode and their totals is displayed in a grid form. Also,
the total number of planets in each of the hemispheres of the wheel, as well
the number of objects in yang/positive/masculine and yin/negative/feminine
quality signs, are counted. To the right of the element table, we have a column
of seven numbers labeled as follows: + is the number of yang objects (i.e.
in Fire or Air signs); - is the number of yin objects (i.e. in Water or
Earth signs); M is the number of objects above the horizon (i.e. in the Southern
hemisphere of the Midheaven); N is the number of objects below the horizon
(in the Northern hemisphere of the Nadir); A is the number of objects in
the Eastern half of the sky (in the hemisphere of the Ascendant); and D is
the number of objects in the Western half of the sky (in the hemisphere of the
Descendant). Note that cusp objects are left out of hemisphere counts (but
still included in the other object summaries) as they would skew things since
they are always in a particular hemisphere. Finally we have a field indicating
the division of objects into the first six and second six signs of the zodiac.
The number of objects in the first six signs of the zodiac will be printed,
labeled by the character &lt;. (The number in the second half isn't printed;
just subtract from the total if you want to know.) According to a book on the Kabbalah,
the emphasis of the first six signs on the zodiac is on whats to learn, and
the emphasis on the second six signs is on whats to share. Use or interpret
this as you wish.</p>

<p class=A>I have taken the liberty to define ruling and exalting signs for the
asteroids (and the rest of the first 22 objects that don't already have them.)
This won't affect much other than whether a 'R', 'd', 'X', or 'f' is displayed
in the -v charts, but it will slightly affect the powers given to these objects
in the -j influence chart since they can be in their ruling sign, etc. The -HO
object list will display the list of ruling and exalting signs (and the detriment
and fall signs which are just opposite the above) for all these objects in
addition to the planets; however, I have listed them below:</p>

<p class=A>Chiron, the compassionate, experienced healer, is most similar in
function to Pisces, hence Chiron rules here. Chiron expresses well in caring,
feeling, Cancer, hence Chiron exalts here. Ceres, goddess of agriculture and
representing the mothering, reproductive instinct, is similar in function to
Taurus, hence Ceres rules here. Ceres expresses well in the nurturing, caring,
sign of Cancer, hence Ceres exalts here. Pallas Athena, mentally acute and
unemotional, is most similar in function to Virgo, hence Pallas rules here.
Pallas expresses well in practical, disciplined, introverted Capricorn, hence
Pallas exalts here. Juno, ability to sacrifice self-interests to maintain a
relationship, is most similar in function to relationship oriented Libra, hence
Juno rules here. Juno expresses well in sociable, crowd pleasing Leo, hence
Juno exalts here. Vesta, with its orientation to directing hidden creative or
sexual energy without fear, is most similar in function to Scorpio, hence Vesta
rules here. Vesta expresses well in individualistic, quirky Aquarius, hence
Vesta exalts here.</p>

<p class=A>The North Node, with its emphasis on being able to break from the
past routine and pursue the unfamiliar and personal growth, is most similar in
function to society questioning independent Aquarius, hence it rules here. The
South Nodes ruling and exalting signs are set to be respectively Leo and Sagittarius,
i.e. the opposite of the North Nodes. The Part of Fortune is calculated based
on the positions of the Sun, Moon, and Ascendant; if these three objects are in
their ruling signs, then the Fortune will fall in Pisces, hence the Fortune
should rule here. Similarly, if the Sun, Moon, and Ascendant are all in their
exalting signs, then the Fortune will fall in Aquarius, hence the Fortune should
exalt here. The Vertex, being always near the Descendant, corresponds to Libra,
and hence has the same rulership and exaltation as Venus: Libra and Pisces. The
  East Point, being always near the Ascendant, corresponds to Mars, and hence
has the same rulership and exaltation as Mars: Aries and Capricorn. Lilith has
the rulership of Scorpio and exaltation in Pisces. House cusps and angles rule
the sign corresponding to them, e.g. Aries for the Ascendant, Taurus for the
2nd Cusp, and so on. House cusp objects exalt in the next sign of the same
element beyond the one they rule, e.g. Aries exalts in Leo.</p>

<p class=A>Each Uranian also has been assigned its own ruling and exalting
sign, meaning Uranians in their rulership, etc, will be flagged as such and
have more or less influence and so on. I also came up with these myself and
used the interpretation strings to decide what the most appropriate signs are.
If you prefer other signs or no sign at all for any of the rulerships, you can
easily change them using the -YJ switch described elsewhere. Specifically,
Cupido rules Libra and exalts in Gemini, Hades rules Scorpio and exalts in
Virgo, Zeus rules Leo and exalts in Aries, Kronos rules Capricorn and exalts in
Sagittarius, Apollon rules Sagittarius and exalts in Aquarius, Admetos rules
Virgo and exalts in Scorpio, Vulkanus rules Aries and exalts in Leo, and
finally Poseidon rules Sagittarius and exalts in Pisces.</p>

<p class=A>The standard chart listing of the planetary positions will also
include an additional field for the velocity of each planet. This velocity
value approximates how fast the planet is moving through the zodiac with
respect to the Earth (or whatever the central body is set to) in degrees per
day. This value of course, goes negative when a planet goes retrograde. This is
useful not only to get a feel for how fast each planet moves through the
zodiac, but to determine when a planet is about to go retrograde or direct, in
which the value approaches zero when the planet is about to change direction.
Velocities will also be displayed for house cusp and related objects like the
Vertex and East Point.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=file>FILES, DATA DEFAULTS, AND COMPILE TIME OPTIONS</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Astrolog includes the ability to search an input file for various
default settings to use in the program. This allows one to easily change major
defaults without having to recompile the program, which is useful if, say, one
receives a compiled executable from a friend who has a different configuration.
The program looks for the file astrolog.as in the current directory, and if not
there, looks for it in the default directory (and in directories indicated by
environment variables if set). Parameters in this file will override any
defaults compiled into the program, although the highest priority is still
given to the command line options. Note one doesn't have to have this file in
order to run the program - if not found Astrolog will still run as before using
compile time defaults.</p>

<p class=A>Astrolog configuration files from versions 4.10 and before (which
were named astrolog.dat) won't work with the current version, because like
the chart info files, the astrolog.as file is also a series of command switches
(see below). The fixed fields used in version 4.10 and before no longer exist,
since there are command switches to do the same things as everything the old
files could set and a whole lot more. Attempting to use any old astrolog.dat
file will cause the program to complain that its not in any valid format. If
you have an old file, delete it and modify the one included with this release
to correspond to your desired settings. Version 4.20 through 7.00 configuration
files are however fully compatible with 7.10 and don't need to be changed.</p>

<p class=A>--</p>

<p class=A>As of Astrolog version 4.20, all files are a series of command
switches that indicate the contents of the file and set the appropriate things
when executed. This is very powerful, extendable, and general. Astrolog still
has the ability to read and write the old chart formats. This affects -o chart
info files, -o0 chart position files, and the astrolog.as config file. In a
sense there is no difference between the three formats, just they are generated
or read in for different situations. Whenever any chart is read in, Astrolog
simply reads in the file a line at a time and processes the switches as if they
were on the command line or entered in a -Q loop.</p>

<p class=A>The astrolog.as config file is one of the files that is a series of
command lines. This change makes the astrolog.as file much more powerful and
versatile than it would be otherwise. The file is not in a fixed format with
fields that have to be in a certain order. You can move lines around, add as
many lines as you want, or take lines out without problem. These config files
shouldn't become out of date in future versions of the program either.
Incompatibilities will only arise if the syntax of a switch changes, and even
then its obvious as to the small correction that needs to be made. Its
important to remember that any switch can be put in the astrolog.as file. For
example, you can change the default behavior of the program when invoked
without any switches, by say putting -n in it, to make the program always
display the chart for now unless you specify otherwise. You may want to put -C
in it if you want the house cusps to always be included in transit and other
charts. If you are always doing graphics charts, you can put -X in there
somewhere so you don't have to put it on the command line. Long or complicated
switches like new planet definitions, and color or interpretation
customizations, are good candidates to put in astrolog.as so they don't have to
be retyped all the time.</p>

<p class=A>The file as generated with the -o switch is also just a couple of
command lines to set the chart information appropriately. (Before version 4.20,
the older file format hadn't changed a bit since files where first introduced
in version 1.20!) Note that you can manually add additional switches to any
chart info file, to have per chart settings. For example, if you are always
displaying a particular natal charts aspect grid, you can put a -g in that
particular file so you don't have to include -g on the actual command line with
the -i file. (Or you can put the -g in the astrolog.as file and have all
charts come up by default in the aspect grid instead of the -v listing.) Note
also that the -i switch is technically a generic command file reader. You can
read any switch file with -i, and even reload the astrolog.as defaults with a
line such as -i astrolog.as.</p>

<p class=A>Since -i will read in and process any command file, you can make
your own arbitrary command files and read them in whenever you want. You aren't
limited to modifying just chart info files and astrolog.as. Say you like to use
a narrower set of orbs for transits. You can make a special file that just sets
a bunch of orbs using the -A switches, and then read it in via -i
narroworbfile and combine it with -t or whatever. Note that command files can
even process other command files inside of them. Remember that astrolog.as is
just a special command file; the program basically just does a -i astrolog.as
internally on startup.</p>

<p class=A>-@ switch: All Astrolog switch files must begin with the '@'
character, which identifies them as such. The switch files as generated with -o
and -o0, and the default astrolog.as file, have a few characters immediately
following the '@' which indicate the file type and program version, included
for potential backward compatibility issues in the future. All Astrolog command
switch files start with a line beginning with @A, followed by a character
identifying the file subtype (which is one of IPDCZ), followed by the program
version number not counting the period (i.e. 710). Specifically, Astrolog
chart info files start with @AI710, chart position files chart with @AP710,
and default settings files like astrolog.as start with @AD710. The city
atlas file atlas.as starts with @AC710, and the time change file timezone.as
starts with @AZ710. Note that the '@' happens to technically be a switch too,
but is only dealt with internally by the program. If you make any of your own
command files to read in with -i, just be sure there is a '@' character (better
yet the sequence of characters @AD710 to be like the default astrolog.as) at
its very beginning and everything will work.</p>

<p class=B>Before version 7.00, an older format was used: The first two digits
after @ indicated file type, in which 01 was a -o chart info file, 02 was
a -o0 chart position file, and 03 was a configuration file like astrolog.as.
The second two digits indicated file version: Chart info files were 0103,
because version 1 of a chart info file was the pre-version 4.20 form, and
version 2 was the pre-version 6.00 form. Chart position files were 0205
because version 4 was the pre-version 6.50 form, version 3 was the pre-version
6.00 form, version 2 was the pre-version 4.20 form, and version 1 was the
pre-version 3.10 form. The astrolog.as file was 0309 because versions 1-7
were all the different old fixed field versions of this dating back to when the
config file was first introduced, and version 8 was the pre-version 6.00
instance of it. Astrolog 7.10 and earlier versions can load each others files
without problem.</p>

<p class=A>Chart position files as generated with the -o0 switch are much
improved over the format used in versions 4.10 and before. The zodiac positions
have an extra two digits of precision and the declinations have an extra one
digit. The newer files include the velocity of the planet and its distance from
the sun, so applying vs. separating aspects and -S orbit charts work perfectly.
(Before the data would be lost.) These files may also include star positions
unlike before, and are more complete with respect to house cusps. The actual
house array is kept separate from the cusp object indexes, meaning that one for
example can reload charts in the Equal house system that disassociate the
Midheaven from the 10th cusp and remember both positions, and even save a -r
synastry chart with -o0 and remember both sets of house cusps on reload.</p>

<p class=A>-YF switch: As -o0 position files are a series of command lines,
there is a switch to set the actual positions of a planet. This is the -YF
switch which takes eight parameters, which are: the index of the object to set
the positions of, the degree within the sign of its position, the zodiac sign
of its position, the minute within the degree of its position, the degree of
its ecliptic latitude, the minute within the degree of the latitude (which
should always be positive, e.g. for a latitude of -10.5 degrees, the parameters
would be -10 and 30), the velocity in degrees per day (positive is direct
motion, negative retrograde), and finally the distance from the Sun or central
body in AU. This switch shouldn't really be used outside of -o0 files as it
causes the chart to be assumed to have no time or space, but is described here
for completeness. Note that another advantage to the newer -o0 files is that
you can again add other switches to them (e.g. -s to indicate if its a
position file for a tropical or sidereal zodiac chart), and rearrange or delete
lines without problem, unlike the older -o0 files which required all the
planets and in a fixed order.</p>

<p class=A>To handle houses, when the -YF switch is called on a house cusp
object, it will set the object itself as well as the corresponding house cusp. However,
the angles are slightly different: Setting the Ascendant or MC objects wont
affect any house cusps, and setting the IC or Descendant objects will also set
both the house cusp, as well as set the opposite house cusp to be 180 degrees
opposite. This allows chart position files to properly cover cases where the
Ascendant is different from the 1st cusp and/or the MC is different from the
10th cusp, and also cases where non-angular houses arent 180 degrees opposite
each other.</p>

<p class=A>Heres an example of one of the switch based command files,
specifically a modern chart info file with the name, city, and Daylight fields
in it. This is much easier to understand and modify than older files, and is
the info for my own natal chart consisting of the three lines below:</p>

<p class=FA>@AI710  ; Astrolog chart info.</p>

<p class=FA>/qb Nov 19 1971 11:01am ST +8:00 122:19:59W 47:36:35N</p>

<p class=FA>/zi &quot;Walter D. Pullen&quot; &quot;Seattle, WA, USA&quot;</p>

<p class=A>--</p>

<p class=A>Astrolog has several environment variables which may be set to
indicate directories where to find the various files it may look for. Without them,
the only place the program will look for chart files, the astrolog.as
initialization file, and ephemeris files is in the current directory and
default directories set at compile time. The program will look where all of
these environment variables point, if they are defined. The three environment
variables are named ASTROLOG, ASTR650, and ASTR. On a PC you can set an
environment variable from the DOS prompt with a command such as set
ASTROLOG=C:\PROGRAMS\ASTRO650\CHARTS. This command can be put in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file to remain persistent. On a Unix system you can set an
environment variable from the shell with a command such as setenv ASTROLOG
~username/programs/astro650/charts. This line can be put in your .cshrc file
to remain persistent. Note that the ASTR650 environment variable is version
specific, i.e. the previous version looked in one called ASTR6.40 instead. This
allows one to have a directory for version specific files such as the astrolog.as
file, and have multiple versions of Astrolog on the system at once without them
conflicting with each other. I personally point ASTROLOG to my chart files
directory, ASTR650 to my astrolog.as directory, and ASTR to my ephemeris
directory, although any file may be found with any of the variables.
Specifically, when Astrolog searches for a file, it will look in the following
directories, in order: The current directory, the ASTR650 environment variable
directory, the ASTROLOG environment directory, the ASTR dir, and finally the
compile time default directory.</p>

<p class=A>--</p>

<p class=A>Some systems (for example, Macs) don't directly accept parameter
switches on the command line (such as Astrolog is being booted from a menu.)
Therefore, such a limitation makes one unable to access many program features
in the normal way. If this is the case with your system (or if you just don't
like command line options), then comment out the '#define SWITCHES' line at the
beginning of the astrolog.h file. If you do this, then the program will ignore
any switches and prompt you to enter them manually at the very beginning of
program execution. You just enter one line containing all the parameters
together, separated by one or more spaces, just like is done when typing in the
command line, or when in the -Q loop mode. Astrolog will automatically parse
the string and extract the parameters, just like the operating system shell
does.</p>

<p class=A>Related to this, the -. switch, when encountered on a command
line, will immediately terminate the program, ignoring any modes or other
command switches. This is the formal way how to really exit the program when in
the -Q loop (and really only useful in this case). Remember, earlier it was
said to enter . for the command line to exit the -Q mode. Astrolog internally
interprets the . as a switch without a leading dash, i.e. -., which is a
switch that will force program termination.</p>

<p class=A>--</p>

<p class=A>I often use Astrolog to look at and compare files containing charts
of various people. I have many chart files, so I keep them in a separate
directory. Since it is always a pain to have to cd into this special directory
all the time, there is a DEFAULT_DIR string to be set at compile time. Whenever
the program reads in a chart file with the -i option, it will first look in the
current directory for it. If its not found there, Astrolog will then look for
a file of the same name in this special default directory (and in directories
indicated by environment variables if set).</p>

<p class=A>A couple of other compile time option variables are in the include
file astrolog.h: For those people who don't like Placidus, a default house
system can be set by changing the value of DEFAULT_SYSTEM to the value from 0
to 11 indicating what system to use if the user doesn't explicitly specify one
with -c or in astrolog.as. A few other compile time options are in astrolog.h
which can be used to leave out certain parts of the program which you don't
desire to have or just take up memory and make the executable larger. The
#define INTERPRET can be commented out to remove all the -I interpretation
routines and tables. The #define BIORHYTHM can be commented out to remove the
non-astrological -rb biorhythm text and graphical charts. And the #define
CONSTEL can be commented out to remove the -XF constellation graphics and -HF
text constellation list. Finally, concerning the source code itself, all of
Astrologs functions have full Ansi prototypes, which can be turned off for
older compilers by commenting out the PROTO #ifdef.</p>

<p class=A>There is a special compile time variable dealing with graphics (in
addition to the X11 and WIN ones) called GRAPH. One comments out the
#define GRAPH line if they don't want any graphics at all, and not just if they
don't have X windows or PC screen graphics. In other words, one can generate
most of Astrologs graphics charts even if they don't have X windows or a PC
with graphics abilities. When GRAPH is defined, but X11 or WIN aren't, the
program will generate the charts, but just never try to bring up a window; it
will simply always assume that you are writing a bitmap file. The bitmap file will
contain a (unfortunately always black and white for the X bitmap format) image
of what would normally be in the window, just as the -Xb switch does. One can
then use various graphics utilities to convert the image into something they
can display on their system if they can't do so using any of the available
bitmap modes. (Any system that can compile Astrolog should be able to compile
in all the non-screen graphics features as well.)</p>

<p class=A>A bitmap output mode other than the Windows .bmp bitmaps and
standard ones that can be read with the Unix X11 xsetroot command is allowed in
the graphics routines. If one changes the BITMAPMODE compile time option in
astrolog.h to the character 'A' when compiling, or invokes the -Xb switch as
-Xba, then all bitmaps output will be in a straight Ascii form, with one
character corresponding to each pixel. This format is identical to the result
produced by the Unix command bmtoa (when the chart is monochrome), and it can
be converted back into a bitmap with the Unix command atobm. Although not as
efficient spacewise, this is a simpler format, and is recommended for those
without screen capabilities who still want to use Astrologs graphics, if they
want to write their own conversion program.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=graphics>DESCRIPTION OF GRAPHICS FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>One of the most impressive features of Astrolog are its graphics
features available for X windows, which are generally accessed in the program
via the -X switch and derivatives of it on the command line. There are seven
different types of chart displays: A standard graphic display of a wheel chart
in a window (with glyphs, aspects in the center, etc), graphic displays of the
Astro-graph charts (which look almost identical to the Astro*Carto*Graphy maps
from Jim Lewis) complete with all the labeled lines drawn on a map of the world
(like the -L option), aspect/midpoint grids showing the aspects and orbs in
effect between every body in a chart (like -g option), a local sky chart
showing where each planet is located on a map of the local horizon area (as in
-Z), a space chart showing an aerial view of the solar system (as in -S), a
dispositor graph chart showing planetary rulership chains (accessed with -j),
and a graphic ephemeris plotting position vs. time (as in -E), in addition to a
couple of non-astrological charts such as calendar (-K) and biorhythm (-rb)
graphics. The X wheel and aspect grid charts can also displayed in a different
manner to accommodate relationship comparison charts showing two sets of
planets at once. There are also other commands that can be given to the window
once it is up and running, which can do other things, such as continually
update the window every few seconds to the current status (i.e. an extended
version of the -n option) as well as other forms of animation. Note that the
program is still text based, and one can turn off all the X features by
commenting out the #define X11 in astrolog.h if they don't have X windows.</p>

<p class=A>Probably the only thing more impressive than the graphics features
are the graphics features displayed on color monitors. Here is how the colors
have been assigned for the various charts: Four colors have been allocated for
the four elements which by default are: Fire = Red, Earth = Brown, Air = Green,
Water = Blue. The various sign glyphs (and the corresponding house labels) are
in the color of their element. Planets are in the color of the sign of their
main ruler. Chiron and the four asteroids are Pink, while the North Node, and
other non-physical objects like the Part of Fortune and Vertex are Blue Gray.
Representations of the Ascendant/ Descendant/ Midheaven/ Nadir (in the
astro-graph map lines and elsewhere) are in the element color of the
corresponding sign/house that the angular lines refer to, i.e. Ascendant = Red,
Midheaven = Brown, Descendant = Green, Nadir = Blue. A few extra things have
been added for color wheel charts only: dark gray lines marking off each house
(in addition to the main lines on the horizon and meridian), and each degree
instead of every 5th degree being marked in dark gray on the outer circle
(every 5th degree being white). Aspects lines are colored too, as follows:
Conjunctions = Yellow, Sextiles = Light Blue, Squares = Red, Trines = Green,
Oppositions = Dark Blue. For the minor aspects we have:
Inconjuncts/Semisextiles = Pink, Semisquares/ Sesquiquadratures = Orange, (Bi/Semi)Quintiles = Blue Gray, (Bi/Tri)Septiles = Maroon, (Bi/Quatro)Noviles =
Violet.</p>

<p class=A>For color terminals, the -XG globe display and -XW world map display
are done with the continents in different colors, also making them look much
better than monochrome maps. Each of the seven continents is in a different
color of the rainbow, and the colors are chosen to correspond to the
appropriate chakra (etheric energy vortex along the human spine) that goes with
each land mass. They are: Africa - red - Root chakra, Australia - orange -
Navel chakra, South America - yellow - Solar plexus chakra, North America -
green - Heart chakra, Europe - blue - Throat chakra, Asia - indigo - Third Eye
chakra, Antarctica - violet - Crown chakra. Lakes within continents are colored
dark blue.</p>

<p class=A>--</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-v -X:</span> The graphic wheel charts have their
graphic information organized as follows: Theres an outer circle showing the
signs and sign glyphs, inside of which is a smaller circle divided up into 5
degree increments to make determining exact degrees easier. Inside of this is a
circle divided up into the 12 houses labeled with numbers. The entire chart is
divided by two dashed lines through the Ascendant/Descendant (which is always
horizontal of course) and the Midheaven/Nadir. Inside the house circle are the
planet glyphs in their appropriate positions. Small pointer lines run from each
glyph to just before single dots. These dots indicate the precise locations in
the zodiac of each object. The pointer lines (which are dashed if the object is
retrograde and solid otherwise) are necessary so as not to have to draw planet
glyphs on top of one another when planets are conjunct. Inside the ring of the
single dots, are the aspect lines connecting these positions. Since the default
number of aspects to use is just the 5 majors, one can determine which aspect
is in place just by looking at the aspect line. The accuracy of the aspect is
determined by the dashedness of the line: A solid line means the orb is &lt; 2
degrees; a dashed line means the orb is 2 to 4 degrees; a really dashed line
mean the orb is 4 to 6 degrees, and so on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-v0 -X:</span> Astrologs wheel charts will be labeled
more extensively than just having the chart header information displayed at the
bottom of the graphic like in other chart modes. The wheels will include full
information on time, place, the charts name and city fields if defined, house
system, zodiac, central planet, element table info (including the count of
objects in angular, succedent, and cadent houses, and the count of objects in
the first six learning signs and the last six sharing signs), as well as
the actual positions of house cusps and planets as displayed in the wheel. All
this information is in a sidebar to the right of the wheel which includes a
listing not unlike the -v text chart. (Note that the size of this sidebar is
such that for a 480x480 pixel chart size, including the sidebar will make it
640x480, which perfectly fills a classic VGA PC screen.)</p>

<p class=B>The sidebar can include house cusp objects in the list of planets.
Each cusp object will only be included if its different from the actual house
cusp, or if its latitude is non-zero. Normally cusp objects are redundant,
since the positions of the 12 houses are already listed, however (for example)
some house systems have the Ascendant different from the 1st house, or the
Midheaven different from the 10th, which means its important to list them.</p>

<p class=B>The sidebar will also include additional lines to indicate less
common chart types, which makes it easier to see when a particular mode is in
effect. Included will be whether the chart is progressed (and if so what date
its progressed to), if the harmonic chart factor has been set, along with
special indicators if the decan, dwad, domal, navamsa, or geodetic houses
settings are on. Solar charts will be indicated too, and will mention how the
planet positions are being rotated. It will indicate what planet is being
rotated to what position, and whether the rotating is to the start of sign,
e.g. Sun on Ascendant or Moons sign on Midheaven.</p>

<p class=B>This sidebar supports relationship charts involving two or more
charts, and for a relationship chart will list both sets of chart information (or
all three or four sets in the case of tri and quad wheels). Each set of chart
information will be properly labeled, such as synastry chart sidebars will
indicate which set of chart information is determining the houses and which the
planets. If you want a simpler style wheel with just the chart information at
the bottom of the graphic, set the -v0 flag, as in -v0 -X, instead of -v -X
or just -X.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-w -X:</span> A different way of formatting the
graphical wheel charts described above is available by combining the -w switch
with -X. Normally all of Astrologs wheel charts are such that each zodiac sign
is the same size. Due to different house sizes in most systems however, this
makes the houses appear different sizes on the wheel, so that the Midheaven
won't be the exact top of the chart for instance. Some users may instead prefer
house oriented as opposed to sign oriented wheel charts. Astrolog, with the
-w -X combination, will make each house be the same size on the screen, and
will compress or expand the signs instead (of course this means that such
things as exact squares may not be between objects exactly 90 degrees apart on
the circle any more). When graphics are displayed on the screen, the '0' key
will toggle between the two forms of wheel chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-L -X:</span> The graphical astro-graph charts are
organized as follows: A map of the world is shown. The edges of the map are
labeled with ruler lines that are 5 degrees apart (with longer ruler lines for
more important longitudes and latitudes, like those that are multiples of 10,
30, etc.) The equator is labeled with a dashed line. The polar regions of the
world aren't shown; the map shown ranges from 60 degrees S latitude to 75
degrees N latitude. Note that each pixel on the screen represents exactly one
half a degree on the world. (For -Xs 100 the ratio is one pixel to one degree, and
for -Xs 400 the ratio is one pixel to 1/4 degree.) On this map are drawn the
lines indicating where on the world the various planets are angular at the time
in question. (Note: you might want to -R restrict some objects because
otherwise the map tends to get pretty cluttered with lines.) As expected,
Midheaven and Nadir lines are vertical, and the Ascendant and Descendant lines
are curved. Little square boxes on the Midheaven lines indicate the exact
zenith latitude location. Each line is labeled at the top or the bottom of the
screen, showing what planet is in question and (sometimes) what angle is in
question. All Ascendant and Midheaven lines are labeled at the bottom of the
screen, and all Descendant and Nadir lines are labeled at the top. Each line goes
a bit beyond to the top or bottom of the world map, and then another pointer
segment (which is again dashed of the object in question is retrograde) goes
and points to the planet glyph. The glyph for the Ascendant or Midheaven is
under each of the glyphs at the bottom of the screen, explicitly indicating
whether the line is an Ascendant or Midheaven line. At the top of the screen,
however, there are only the glyphs, but one can still determine whether these
lines are Descendant or Nadir lines based on whether they are curved or not.
Note that not all the Descendant lines are labeled; this is because some of the
Ascendant/Descendant lines actually connect near the top of the screen and
don't actually cross it. (Where the Ascendant and Descendant lines meet, those points
are intersected by the planets Midheaven or Nadir lines.) This graphic
astro-graph chart will display a small purple dot at the precise point on the
world map for which the chart in question is being generated. This is useful to
help see how close the various planetary lines are to you, if you live in the
middle of the continent or someplace not easily determinable on the compact map
of the world.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-L0 -X:</span> Graphic astro-graph charts will be done
slightly differently if done by combining -L0 with -X. A thin horizontal line
will be drawn all across the map of the world at the latitude of the chart in
question. Normally, theres only a small dot at the precise location. In
astro-graph charts, intersections between lines anywhere at the same latitude
of a natal chart, even if any number of degrees away longitudinally, will
affect the person, in the same way but not as strong as if they are directly
under the intersection itself. This small chart modification can make finding
such intersections easier in the graphics chart, just as -L0 for text charts
actually lists the latitudes of all crossings.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-g -X:</span> Aspect grid graphics with the
appropriate aspect glyphs can be displayed by combining the -g option with the
-X option (astrolog -g -X). Both the split aspect/midpoint grids labeled down
the diagonal, as well as the relationship aspect grids between two charts
(astrolog -r0 &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; -g -X) are supported. The aspect
glyphs, objects, and the signs in the grids are in their colors as defined earlier.
Like the astro-graph windows, these charts can't be resized in the normal way
unless one uses the '&gt;' and '&lt;' keys. For anything less than the larger
scale sizes (achieved with the switch -Xs 300, or by pressing '&gt;' within a
window) all that will be displayed in each aspect grid cell is the glyphs of
the aspect in effect, the planet being aspected, or the sign of the midpoint.
However, once the largest scale size is reached, there is room in each cell to
display the aspect orb to the nearest minute off of exact (with a plus or minus
sign indicating whether the actual angle is slightly greater than or less than
exact, or an 'a' or 's' if applying vs. separating orbs are to be shown
instead); the degree and minute in addition to the sign for midpoints; and the
degree and sign location for each planet thats in the grid, as with the -g
text charts. This chart will show the nearest arc second of orbs and midpoints
when the -b0 print nearest second setting is on, and when the -Xs character
scale factor is 400 (so that theres enough room to include seconds).</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-m -X:</span> Combining the -m switch with -X will
have the same result as -g with -X, since the aspect grid shows both aspects
and midpoints separated by the grid diagonal. However, doing a relationship
midpoint chart (-r0 -m -X) will result in the relationship aspect grid coming
up but showing the midpoints instead of aspects, as desired. The -r0 -m -X
switch combination implicitly does the results of the -g0 switch, which for
relationship charts puts midpoints instead of aspects in the grid.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Z -X:</span> The -Z local horizon feature can be
displayed in an X window as well (e.g. astrolog -Z -X), in which all the
planets will be displayed in a window depicting the sky. The small dot above or
below each glyph indicates exactly where each planet is. (Some of the glyphs
may be overlapping, although the program tries to avoid this.) There is a
horizontal line dividing the window representing the local horizon; planets
above this line are visible, while planets below it are set. There are three
vertical lines dividing the window as well: The middle line represents the due
south direction, the one to the left is due east, the one to the right is due
west, and the edges of the window are due north. (These directions are labeled
in the borders of the chart.) Like the standard chart display, this window or
graphic may be resized to any proportion. At any time one can press the 'Z' key
when a graphic is up to enter this display type in that window.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Z0 -X:</span> An additional graphics chart is
available through the -Z0 switch: local horizon charts suitable for stargazing.
The normal -Z switch generates a listing of the planets with respect to the
local horizon, and the -Z combined with the -X switch generates a graphic image
of the planets and stars on the local horizon. That chart assumes one is facing
due south, and is divided left to right by the horizon line, with straight up
being toward the top of the screen and straight down toward the bottom. That is
a good chart, especially for noticing the rising and setting of planets and
other objects, but the fact that the meridian is split up causes distortion
when trying to view objects high up in the sky. Therefore, if one combines this
-Z0 switch with the -X switch, a differently oriented local horizon chart will
be displayed. Here, the zenith point straight up is in the center of the
screen, and the horizon line is a surrounding circle. Due north is along the
line from the center to the top of the screen, due south is on the line from
the center to the bottom, east is to the left, and west is to the right. In
other words, this is just like what one would see if they were lying on their
back looking straight up with their feet to the south, so this should be better
for stargazing. Outside the circle marks whats below the horizon, and the
extreme corners of the screen mark the nadir or whats straight down. All
points below the horizon are compressed to fit between the horizon circle and
the outer boundary square, allowing all points in the sky to be visible. As
with the normal -Z graphic chart, this one has the various axes marked at five
degree increments.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-S -X:</span> The -S switch can be combined with -X to
give a graphics chart of the solar system. This will be displayed as an aerial
view of the entire solar system, with 0 degrees Aries to the left of the
screen, 0 degrees Cancer to the bottom, etc. Whatever object is chosen to be
the central body is at the center of the screen, with all the others around it.
This is a fun chart to animate, in that one can watch the planets orbit around
the Sun, and see how they turn retrograde with respect to the Earth. In
addition to the bodies themselves, twelve spokes are drawn from the center body
to the edge of the chart, which delineate the zodiac with respect to it. This
chart will also label the zodiac signs, with sign glyphs around the outside
edge of the chart. These glyphs and the lines to mark the sign boundaries can
be toggled with the show house details setting (-XC switch). This chart can
also display aspect lines between the planets. The aspects present will be with
respect to the central body, and will be the same aspects as seen in the aspect
grid or in the middle of a wheel chart. The display of these aspects can be
toggled with the show equator setting (-Xe switch).</p>

<p class=B>Note that the scale of the solar system is large, which means
attempting to fit all the planets out to Pluto on the screen at once will cause
all the inner planets to be crammed together near the middle of the screen. To
deal with this, the scale size as indicated with the -Xs switch and the '&lt;'
and '&gt;' keys will affect how much of the solar system is viewed at once (in
addition to controlling the glyph sizes). For a scale size of 100, the viewing
region will have a wide radius of 90 AU, enough to easily include the entire
solar system, as well as the orbits of the hypothetical Uranian bodies beyond
Pluto. For the default scale size of 200, it will have a radius of 30 AU,
enough to include Neptune (and Pluto most of the time). For a scale size of
300, the viewport will have a radius of 6 AU (about out to the orbit of
Jupiter, which is useful for viewing the inner planets). Finally for a scale
size of 400, the viewing region will have a radius of 1 AU (just enough to
cover the Earths orbit). At a 400% scale zoom with the Moon included as well,
one can actually get a feel for the relative distance of the Sun from the Earth
and the Moon from the Earth, although the chart will have to be over 1000
pixels wide for the Moon to even appear one pixel away from the Earth! If the
scale size is 400, and the -XS graphic text scale is set to 200 or larger, then
the viewing region will be a very small 0.006 AU, which is just large enough to
fit the Moons orbit, so works well with geocentric or Moon object centered
charts, to see the motion of the Moon, Nodes, and Lilith around the Earth. Note
that if the -b ephemeris files setting is off, then Earths Moon will be left
out.</p>

<p class=B>This chart can display star objects, as well as the list of
additional stars. If stars objects are unrestricted, or the list of additional
stars is being shown, then their positions will be plotted in this chart.
Because stars are so far away, the chart scaling will be in light years instead
of Astronomical Units (AU), which is a factor of about 63000. That will make
all planets appear to be overlapping in the middle of the chart, and as a
result when showing stars its recommended to restrict all non-star objects
except the Sun. Astrologs 3D wireframe file of this chart will plot stars in
3D space, resulting in a 3D environment in which one can explore the local area
of the galaxy. For example, the Astrolog animation <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/dipper.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/dipper.gif</a>
flies through space around the Big Dipper, allowing one to see how it appears
from different angles.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-l -X:</span> The Gauquelin sector chart may be
displayed in graphical form by combining the -l switch with -X, where the 36
sectors will be arranged in a wheel, with chart header info displayed at the
bottom or in a sidebar as with regular wheels. Each planet will be plotted at
its appropriate sector location, with plus zone sectors labeled in red and
minus in dark green, and aspects will be indicated in the middle of the wheel.
This chart also has the plus or minus zone status of each sector indicated by a
small plus or minus sign around the outside border of the wheel. The sidebar in
this graphic Gauquelin sector wheel chart will to the right of each planet position
show the sector number the planet falls in. (Normally this is just the glyph
for the object in question like it is for the other wheels.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-j -X:</span> Graphic dispositor charts are available
by combining the -j influence switch with -X. This is a another graphics chart
format that can also be switched to whenever screen graphics are up by pressing
the 'J' key. The dispositor of a planet is the planet that rules the sign its
located in. For example, if you have Venus in Aries, the dispositor for your
Venus is Mars. A graph can be made showing an arrow from each planet to its
dispositor. A final dispositor is a planet who is its own dispositor, i.e. in
its ruling sign with no arrows pointing away from it. There can also be two
planets in whats called mutual reception (or a reception loop of more than
two) if they are each others dispositor, e.g. Venus in Aries and Mars in
Libra. Astrologs dispositor chart will show four subgraphs, one in each
quadrant. Both a sign dispositor graph, as described above, and a house
dispositor graph, where each planet is linked to the planet ruling the house its
in, are shown. In addition, both types have the same information displayed in
two different useful formats: a wheel with the planets around the perimeter,
and in a hierarchy with final dispositors at the top and the other planets
stacked based on how many levels they are from final ones. Final dispositors
are circled in white, while those in reception loops are circled in gray, and
dispositor arrows within the top level (i.e. in reception loops) are in white
too instead of the color of the planet for easy identification. For a demo of
the dispositors in your own chart, do astrolog -i yourchartfile -j -X.</p>

<p class=B>This chart normally graphs standard rulership dispositors, and will
include all non-star and non-cusp objects within it. However, if standard
rulerships are restricted (-YR7 switch) and esoteric rulerships arent, then it
will instead graph esoteric rulerships. If esoteric rulerships are graphed,
then the chart will always include Earth and Vulcan (which means Vulcan should
be unrestricted so its position isnt 0Aries) for 12 planets instead of 10 in
the chart. If both standard and esoteric rulerships are restricted and
Hierarchical rulerships arent, then this will instead graph Hierarchical
rulerships.</p>

<p class=B>If the modify display setting (-Xi switch) is on, then final
dispositor objects wont be circled. If the Vedic wheel display setting (-J
switch) is on, then the dispositor wheels will arrange objects clockwise
instead of counterclockwise around them. If the show house details setting (-XC
switch) is on, then the dispositor wheels will have the Sun or first object at
the top of the wheel instead of at the left.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-7 -X:</span> A graphical ephemeris of esoteric Ray
influences is available by combining the -7 esoteric chart switch with -X. This
chart is effectively the Ray power values in the -7 switch text mode chart
graphed over time. The seven Rays and their powers (and average power) are
listed on the horizontal axis, and time on the vertical axis. If the modify
chart setting is on, this chart will graph an entire year instead of just a
month. If the -Xi alternate display mode is on, it will graph the slice power
of each Ray instead of the count power. If the -Xl show glyph labels setting
is on, this display will have a horizontal line drawn across the chart
indicating the day and time in question, to make it easier to see where in the
month or year the chart time actually is. The -YX7 &lt;num&gt; switch specifies
the width in influence units of each Rays column in the esoteric graphic
ephemeris. For example, given -YX7 600, then a Ray influence value of 400
will fill 2/3 of the column.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-K -X:</span> Graphic calendar charts are available by
combining the -K calendar chart with -X. This is another graphics format that
can be switched to whenever screen graphics are up by pressing the 'K' key.
This shows a calendar for the month of the current chart, like the
corresponding text chart but in graphic format with boxes for each day like a
real calendar. The current day within the month will be highlighted in green
(if the -Xl label inhibitor flag isn't on). The -Xi alternate display mode will
put the date numbers in the middle of their box instead of in the upper left
corner. Finally the -Xt chart info display flag for this particular chart will
control how the date numbers are justified in their box. The -Ky yearly
calendar switch may be combined with -X switch to generate a graphic calendar
for the entire year. When the graphic calendar for the year is drawn, the 12
individual months will be arranged in either a 2x6 grid, a 3x4 grid, a 4x3
grid, or a 6x2 grid, based on the dimensions of the chart; for example, a
square chart will be drawn three months across by four down, but a tall skinny
chart will cause the calendar layout to be in a 2x6 grid.</p>

<p class=B>The graphic calendar will include aspect and other events times
within each days box, if the show glyphs on aspect lines setting is active
(-XA switch). This effectively combines the graphic calendar with the transit
to transit times search (-d switch). Depending on the amount of room available
in the boxes, displayed will be the aspect event, its exact time, and markers
for void of course Moon and Moon phases. Do you miss the aspect calendars in
Jim Maynards Celestial Guide and Pocket Astrologer books, after they stopped
printing them? This feature can allow you to make your own. :)</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-E -X:</span> A graphical planetary tracking chart is
available by combining the -E switch with -X. This graphical ephemeris will
display the sign degrees of the zodiac along the horizontal axis, and the days
in the given month along the vertical. The positions of the planets at each day
(at the time and zone from the current chart) are then graphed. The result is a
bunch of wavy lines that make it easy to see all the planetary movements during
the month. Wherever lines cross theres a conjunction on the day indicated on
the axis at the same level as the crossing. Although this only looks at the
month in the given chart information, the actual day will be highlighted on the
vertical axis. In the -r0 relationship comparison mode, this chart will have in
addition to the standard ephemeris lines for the first chart, dashed vertical
lines drawn at the positions of the planets in the second chart, at the time
the ephemeris is done for. If the -Xl show glyph labels setting is on, this
display will have a horizontal line drawn across the chart indicating the day
and time in question, to make it easier to see where in the month or year the
chart time actually is.</p>

<p class=B>Combining the -Ey yearly ephemeris switch with -X will generate a
graphical ephemeris showing the movements for the entire year, with the months
labeled along the vertical axis. Also, this chart can graph multiple years
instead of just one year: The parameter passed to the -EY multiple ephemeris
years switch (which is also present in the Years To Span field in the
Transits dialog in the Windows version) will determine how many years the
graphic ephemeris covers.</p>

<p class=B>If the -gp or -ap parallel aspects setting is active, then this
chart will instead graph planetary latitudes, instead of zodiac position
longitudes. In this alternate display, planets are normally clustered near the
0 degree mark. The -YX7 switch setting sets the radius in tenths of degrees to
include, e.g. -YX7 100 shows +/- 10 degrees on either side of 0 degrees
latitude, -YX7 50 shows +/- 5 degrees, and so on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-Nl -X:</span> Astrolog can display a graphical
version of its atlas, which plots the location of nearby cities on a map. This
chart also draws directional lines toward where on Earth each planet is at its
zenith. (This local space compass view is used in locational astrology, and its
lines are somewhat related to the angle lines in astrocartography.) Show this
chart by combining the -Nl nearest cities chart switch with -X, or in the
Windows version by selecting the new Chart / Nearest Cities command. As with
the telescope chart, you can pan and zoom the part of the earth viewed with the
rotation and zoom commands and hotkeys. Right clicking on the chart will bring
up a context menu allowing one to toggle different settings which determine what
things are shown in the chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-r0 -X:</span> True relationship wheel charts can be
displayed in a window, i.e. where the planets of both charts are displayed in
separate rings of the same wheel. Use the -r0 option to display this comparison
type. For example, for the command astrolog -r0 person1 person2 -X, the
following is displayed: The signs and houses as in person1s chart are drawn in
the outermost part of the wheel. Inside this is a ring of person2s planets as
displayed in person1s houses, and inside of this are person1s own planets.
Finally at the very middle is an aspect grid, which shows those aspects that
are occurring between the objects in the two charts. Basically this is just the
standard wheel chart for person1, except that person2s planets are in an outer
ring of objects and the aspect grid shows the aspects of the relationship.
Putting such a chart in animation mode only affects person2s planets, so this
is a great way to analyze transits: Doing astrolog -t yourchartfile -X will
show all your current transits, and allow you to easily animate the transiting
planets through your natal signs and houses.</p>

<p class=A><span class=S>-rb -X:</span> Graphical biorhythm charts are
available by combining the -rb (or -yb) switch with -X. This will make a graph
of ones biorhythm for the two weeks before and after the specified time, with
days on the horizontal axis and the Physical, Emotional, and Intellectual percentages
on the vertical. When any graphics chart is up, one may press the 'Y' key to
revert to a biorhythm chart. (Note that as this is a relationship comparison
chart, if you go to it from a graphics mode only showing one chart, it will
show the biorhythm for them at their birth, and you will want to then animate
or adjust it to get a useful display.)</p>

<p class=A>--</p>

<p class=A>A couple of conveniences for the graphics features exist. Note that
the -Xo &lt;graphicsfilename&gt; option is only used in conjunction with the
-Xb write output to bitmap switch (or the -Xp or -XM PostScript and metafile
chart formats). Therefore, -Xo automatically assumes -Xb is set. (Invoking -Xb
itself without -Xo will have the program prompt the user for the bitmap
filename.) In other words, astrolog -Xb -Xo 'file' is the same as just astrolog
-Xo 'file'. Astrolog includes its own appropriate X bitmap (the same ringed
planet with moons seen in the Windows version) if one iconifies its X window.</p>

<p class=A>For X windows, one can animate a graphics chart on the root background
by combining -XB with the -Xn switch. This will be just like the animations
done in windows except the root is being used instead. Astrolog can be run in
the background this way to continually update your root to the current chart
representing the present moment. Limitations with this are that since theres
no window, no keypresses can be processed so the program must be manually
terminated, and that the continual updates will be as CPU intensive as the
window animations are.</p>

<p class=A>Text in graphics charts is done using Astrologs own internal font.
This font includes glyphs for the high-Ansi 128-255 character range. These
glyphs cover the common Windows-1252 codepage, which is a superset of ISO
8859-1 (Latin 1) but with extra characters defined for the 128-159 range.</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=windows>DESCRIPTION OF MS WINDOWS FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Users of other versions of the program should find moving to the Microsoft
Windows version of Astrolog easy and familiar. All the text and graphics chart
displays are available and look the same.&nbsp;All chart info and command files
work and haven't changed format any. All the command line switches are
available and work and can even be passed to the program while running to do
things if you prefer, in addition to the more user-friendly interface being
available. All the keypress commands one can press while an interactive
graphics screen was up are set as shortcuts for equivalent operations here.
Basically, additional features and a more user friendly interface are
presented, while all the other things are still available. :)</p>

<p class=A>Not counting the About box and the standard Windows open file, save
file, and printing items, Astrolog contains 16 dialogs, a couple of which are
also shared by more than one command. There are nine top level menus not
counting the system menu, which have among them 121 different options, or 270
counting all second level submenus! In using the dialogs, one should specify or
enter the appropriate settings, and then press OK for them to take effect, or
Cancel to discard any changes made. On pressing OK, the program will check
all the fields for validity, and display an appropriate error message and not
close the dialog if anything is out of range, giving a chance to correct or
cancel. For numeric controls, note that if the existing value is displayed with
a decimal point in it, floating point numbers are legal, while if there isn't
one then integers are required.</p>

<p class=A>Every menu command has an accelerator, i.e. an underscore below a
letter, where when the menu is displayed one may press that letter to select
that option (pressing Alt plus the appropriate letter may be used to pull down
a top level menu). In addition every menu option has a unique direct keyboard
shortcut, where pressing the appropriate key will invoke the command directly
without having to pull down a menu. To the right of each menu option is listed
the key or key combination thats its shortcut. Note that a capital letter here
means the shift key needs to be down, e.g. Alt+o means hold down the Alt key
and press o, while Alt+O means hold down both the Alt and Shift keys and
then press O.</p>

<p class=A>Astrolog tries to be smart about what youre trying to do when menu
options are selected, and may automatically change settings to make the
appropriate thing happen. For example, as with the DOS and X Windows versions,
the charts in the Windows version can be divided into text mode i.e. just
text, and graphics mode charts, where the first option on the View menu will
switch between them. Charts like transit lists only exist in text form, so when
selected you'll automatically leave graphics mode if in it; likewise, selecting
most any item on the Graphics menu will enter it as those settings have no
effect on text charts. Similarly, entering animation mode will automatically
turn on the flicker free updates setting, and so on.</p>

<p class=A>As with Astrolog versions on other platforms, you can use the mouse
to draw on the window here too. Click and drag the left mouse button to
scribble lines. Doing a Shift+click will draw a straight line from the location
you last clicked to the current position. Doing a Control+click will draw a
rectangle with opposite corners at the location last clicked and the current
position. Doing Control+Shift+click will draw an ellipse with opposite corners
at the two positions clicked. Finally, when the current display is either the
world map or an astro-graph chart, one may do Alt+click on the map to relocate
the chart to the spot on the world clicked upon, which will change the
longitude and latitude of the current chart info in memory. For the right mouse
button, you can click and drag to rotate various graphics charts: The chart
sphere and globe displays can be rotated and well as tilted, while the astro-graph
and world map and polar globe displays can be rotated back and forth along
their single axis.</p>

<p class=A>The window that the charts are drawn in has horizontal and vertical
scrollbars on it. For charts that are just text, the scrollbars may be used to
shift the chart up or left to view any characters that get written off the
bottom or right edge of the window. For charts that are graphics, if the chart
is larger than the window its in, the scrollbars may be used to move around
the viewable portion of it, while if the chart is smaller than the window, the
scrollbars will control where in the window the chart is drawn, e.g. centered,
in upper left corner, etc. Note that its most common and logical to have the
chart and window the same size, in which case moving the scrollbars has no
effect on the graphics chart. Note that for text mode charts, if the window has
been scrolled down so that all the text is off the top of the screen, then the
program will automatically scroll up and redraw again, so the bottom 20 rows or
so are visible.</p>

<p class=A>Like other versions, Astrolog for Windows will read in and process
the contents of the astrolog.as command file if available on startup for
default settings. Immediately after this the program will process the contents
of the Windows command line if any, i.e. any command switches or parameters
specified with either the programs icon or given when running the program by
typing in its path.</p>

<p class=A>In Windows explorer, Astrologs icon is a yellow ringed planet with
two blue moons. Astrolog setup claims ownership the file extension .as,
standing for Astrolog Switch file. The .as extension files appear in Windows
as a gray ringed planet icon. Double clicking a .as file (or right clicking
it and selecting Open) will launch Astrolog and have it automatically open
that file. Right clicking a .as file and selecting Edit will open the file
in the text editor Notepad.</p>

<p class=A>--</p>

<p class=A>Astrolog for Windows is reasonably intuitive to use and do what you
want with even without referring to any documentation. Still for completeness
and detail, below is a quick rundown on all the menu options. Where applicable,
the command switch corresponding to the menu command is given in brackets. One
may look up the documentation for that command switch in earlier sections for
additional information.</p>

<p class=A>Note that each graphics chart has a unique popup menu that can be
brought up by right-clicking on the window. There are 13 different popup menus,
which allow changing settings specialized to that graphics chart. This is a
quick and easy way to modify charts in ways that may not be readily apparent
otherwise.</p>

<p class=Section2>File menu commands:</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Open Chart...:</span> This brings up the standard
Windows open file dialog, allowing one to select a chart info, chart position,
or any other Astrolog command file. This file will be loaded and processed,
with the new chart being displayed in the window. [This does the same as the -i
&lt;file&gt; command switch. Note that this ignores the various Astrolog
directory environment variables that -i can use.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Open Chart #2...:</span> This also brings up the
Windows open dialog, allowing one to select a chart file, however any chart
time and location settings will be put into the second chart slot, as used in
relationship charts. [This does the same as the -r &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;
switch, just that it only sets the contents of &lt;file2&gt;.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Save Chart Info...:</span> This brings up the standard
Windows save file dialog, allowing one to enter a filename, which will be
created and the time and location of the current chart will be written to it. If
a file is specified without the extension delimiter &quot;.&quot; in the name,
then the default extension .as will automatically appended. If for some
reason one really does want to save a file without any extension, they should
just append a . to the filename to give it a zero length extension. Note
that, as with all of Astrologs Save dialogs, this will query for a
confirmation before overwriting or replacing existing files. [This does the
same as the -o &lt;file&gt; switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Save Chart Positions...:</span> This also brings up
the Windows save dialog, however here to the created file will be written the
actual positions of all the planets and house cusps, and no time or location
info. [This does the same as the -o0 &lt;file&gt; switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Save Chart Text Output...:</span> This allows one to
save the actual text displayed in a window for a text chart to a file as simple
text. [This does the same as the -os &lt;file&gt; switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Save Chart Bitmap...:</span> This saves the current
graphics display to a Windows bitmap file. [This does the same as the -Xb
switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Save Chart Picture...:</span> This saves the current
graphics display to a Windows metafile file. [This does the same as the -XM
switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Save Chart PostScript...:</span> This saves the
current graphics display to an encapsulated PostScript file. [This does the
same as the -Xp switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Save Chart Wireframe:</span> This saves a special 3D
version of the current graphics display to a Daedalus 3D wireframe file. [This
does the same as the -X3 switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Save Settings...:</span> This allows one to save
settings made within the program so they will automatically be in effect again
the next time the program is run. Without this, one can change settings such as
the house system, aspect orbs, etc, but they will go away upon exiting the
program. The way to make setting changes persistent is to edit the astrolog.as
default settings file. This command has the program automatically generate a
new astrolog.as file for you based on the current state of the program. The
standard Windows Save dialog will be brought up as with all the other Save
commands. The default filename to save to will of course be astrolog.as, to replace
the existing settings file. You can select a different name to save the file to
if you like, where the file will be a command switch file like any other except
it won't be read in automatically on startup like astrolog.as. Note this
feature won't save every possible program setting, such as the active chart
being displayed, but it will save most things; see the astrolog.as file itself
for what exactly is saved. One can start the program, immediately do File Save
Settings, and create an astrolog.as file virtually identical to the one that
was just read in.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Save As Wallpaper:</span> This submenu allows one to
easily set an Astrolog graphics chart to be the background bitmap for the
Windows desktop. This functionality can be done without this command, in which
one can do File Save Bitmap to create a bitmap file, then go into the Windows
control panel desktop settings, and point the wallpaper bitmap to the file
created. However this command allows it do be done with a click of the mouse,
during which a bitmap file called Astrolog.bmp will automatically be created
and saved in your Windows directory. The five commands under this submenu are:</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Tile Bitmap:</span> This command centers the Astrolog
chart in the middle of the screen.</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Center Bitmap:</span> This command tiles the chart
across and down it.</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Stretch Bitmap:</span> This command stretches or
shrinks both chart dimensions separately to cover the background dimensions.</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Fit Bitmap:</span> This command will stretch or shrink
the bitmap to just fit within the desktop while preserving proportion, so will
leave space on the horizontal or vertical edges if the proportions are
different from the background.</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Fill Bitmap:</span> This command will stretch or
shrink the bitmap to completely fill the desktop area while preserving
proportion, so will crop content on the horizontal or vertical edges of the
bitmap if its proportions are different from the background. Note the Fit and
Fill commands will only work on Windows 7 or later, which supports these
styles of background.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Print...:</span> This feature allows one to directly
print charts from within the program. This command brings up the standard
Windows Print dialog, with the same look and feel and options available as when
printing from other Windows programs such as Write. The image printed will be
the exact chart that appears in the window. For graphics charts, the printout
will be a one page image of the display, scaled to be as large as possible
within the bounds of the page. The windows horizontal and vertical scrollbars
determine where in the page the image is situated, e.g. if the vertical
scrollbar is all the way to the top, the image will be at the top of the page,
if centered, then it will be vertically centered, and so on. Note that the
colors in the window will be the colors on the paper, where you probably want
to have the Graphics Reverse Background setting active, so the chart will be
black on a white background and hence not waste ink. For monochrome printers
you also probably want to have the Graphics Monochrome setting active, to
prevent colors like yellow coming out as a hard to see light gray. For text
mode charts, the printout will be on a white background regardless of whats in
the window. You may want to turn off the View Colored Text setting if you don't
have a color printer. The font size may be affected by the Graphics Character
Scale command settings. For the standard medium character scale on a
8.5&quot;x11 paper, there will be 70 rows to a page. The text printout will be
more than one page if there are more than 70 rows of output. Note that even
with this feature available, one may still want to use the programs clipboard
and file features to print from another program. Astrologs Print command makes
decisions about layout, font, etc, for you; some may find this convenient, but
others may still prefer to import Astrolog output into a word processing or
desktop publishing program to have full control. The graphics generated by
printing a chart directly, and printing a chart bitmap, metafile, or PostScript
file, have slightly different textures so one may prefer one format to another.
Still, direct printing is available to those of us who would like to use it.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Print Setup...:</span> This brings up the standard
Windows Print Setup dialog, allowing one to select settings such as the printer
to print to, and whether the printed page will be oriented in portrait or
landscape mode. This dialog is also accessible from the Print dialog itself via
the Setup... button, but is also made available separately here.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Exit:</span> This terminates the program. Note that pressing
Control+C or q will also quit in addition to this and the commands Escape shortcut
key.</p>

<p class=Section2>Edit menu commands:</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Enter Command Line...:</span> This brings up a dialog
with one edit control, in which one may enter a command line. This gives access
to obscure program features that don't have their own menu options yet, as well
as easy access to the command switches for those who work with them. This
dialog also has a Enable AstroExpression Hooks checkbox, which can be used to
enable, disable, or check the status of that feature area.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Run Macro (Normal Set):</span> This, along with the
next three menu items of Run Macro (Shift Set), Run Macro (Control Set),
and Run Macro (Alt Set), are submenus each of which contain 12 entries of the
form Macro &lt;1-48&gt;. These run the appropriate command switch macro. See
the -M0 switch for information on how to define a macro. [This does the same as
the -M switch.]</p>

<p class=B>Note that pressing F1 will show documentation and do the same as the
Help / Open Documentation command. Thats assuming macro #1 hasnt been
defined (if macro #1 has been defined, F1 will still invoke that macro).
Similarly, pressing Alt+F4 will follow the Windows standard and close the
program (instead of first displaying an error about macro #40 not being defined,
and then closing). If macro #40 has been defined, Alt+F4 will still only invoke
that macro.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Copy Chart Text Output:</span> This is like the File
Save Chart Text Output command except the text will be copied to the Windows
clipboard. After doing this one can run or switch to an application such as
Notepad, Write, or Word, and use their Edit Paste command to paste in the chart
text, which may then be printed, combined with other text, and so on. Next to
the Print command, this is the easiest way to print Astrolog charts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Copy Chart Bitmap:</span> This is like the File Save
Chart Bitmap command except the Windows bitmap will be copied to the clipboard,
which may again be pasted into another application.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Copy Chart Picture:</span> This is like the File Save
Chart Picture command except the Windows metafile will be copied to the
clipboard. Note that when printing to laser printers, the Picture format is
recommended over the Bitmap format because its output is free of any pixel
blockiness.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Copy Chart PostScript:</span> This is like the File
Save Chart PostScript command except the PostScript file will be copied to the
clipboard as simple text.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Copy Chart Wireframe:</span> This is like the File
Save Chart Wireframe command except the 3D wireframe file will be copied to the
clipboard as simple text.</p>

<p class=Section2>View menu commands:</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Show Graphics:</span> This toggles the current chart
display between text and graphics mode. Text charts are drawn in the window as
simple text such as might appear in a command prompt, while graphics charts are
pretty high resolution wheels and the like. [This does the same as the -X
switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Buffer Redraws:</span> This option on the Window
Settings submenu toggles whether or not screen updates are smooth. When off,
the screen clears and the chart redraws as you watch, while when on, the
program pauses while the update is done behind the scenes after which the new
chart is displayed all at once. Animation mode automatically turns this setting
on to provide flicker free updates.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Redraw Screen:</span> This option on the Window
Settings submenu simply redraws the current screen. Most often this is used to
erase any scribbles one may have added with the mouse buttons.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Clear Screen:</span> This option on the Window
Settings submenu simply erases the screen leaving a blank window, where the
next redraw will bring the chart back. This can be used if one wants to draw on
an empty screen.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Hourglass On Redraw:</span> This option on the Window
Settings submenu toggles whether or not the program puts up the hourglass wait
cursor while redrawing a chart. I've found it most natural to have this on
normally to know when the program is busy calculating, but off during
animations.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Chart Resizes Window:</span> This option on the Window
Settings submenu toggles whether the window will resize when the chart size
increases or decreases. For example, if displaying a graphic aspect grid which
is a square chart, and one switches to the rectangular shaped astro-graph map
chart, this setting when on, will resize the window to be the new rectangular
shape. When off, the chart will either not fill up the whole window or will
overlap its edges, in which case the scrollbars may be used to view all parts
of the graphic. Note that when the window size changes in this way, the program
will automatically move the windows location appropriately if the new size would
make the window appear partially off the screen edge.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Window Resizes Chart:</span> This option on the Window
Settings submenu toggles whether the chart will resize whenever the window size
is increased or decreased. For example, when displaying the graphic wheel
chart, and one manually resizes the window to be larger, this setting when on,
will make the wheel bigger too so its fills the new window. [Note that the X
Windows version of Astrolog always behaves as though this and the above setting
are both on.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Size Chart To Window:</span> This option on the Window
Settings submenu does a one time resize of the chart to fill the dimensions of
the current window. This is only relevant for graphics charts that don't
already have a forced fixed size, and for when the Window Resizes Chart setting
is off.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Size Window To Chart:</span> This option on the Window
Settings submenu does a one time resize of the window to be the dimensions of
the current chart. This is only relevant for graphics charts and for when the
Chart Resizes Window setting is off.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Size Window Full Screen:</span> This option on the
Window Settings submenu (accessible with the Shift+Tab hotkey) toggles the
Astrolog window into or out of full screen mode. The scrollbars will determine
the relative placement of the Astrolog chart within the screen, if they have
different proportions (e.g. scrollbars centered will center the chart within
the screen).</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Scroll Page Up, Scroll Page Down, Scroll to Beginning,
Scroll to End:</span> These four commands on the Window Settings submenu allow
one to respectively: scroll the window up as if one clicked above the thumbnail
on the vertical scrollbar, scroll the window down as if one clicked below the
thumbnail on the vertical scrollbar, do the same thing as if one scrolls to the
far upper left, and do the same thing as if one scrolls to the far bottom
right. Note that one will generally want to use the keyboard shortcuts for
these commands (the Page Up, Page Down, Home, and End keys) rather then select
them from the menu, but theyre on the menu too just for convenience.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Colored Text:</span> This toggles whether or not the
characters in text charts are multi-colored. Colored text is recommended to
have on normally because it looks nice, but should be turned off when saving
text output to file or copying text to the clipboard to remove the control
characters which cause the color changes. [This does the same as the -k
switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Set Colors...:</span> This brings up the Set Colors
dialog. One may use the various combo controls to change the colors used in
graphics and text charts, by selecting a color from a dropdown, or by entering
its name or abbreviation or index from 0-15. The Standard Color Palette covers generic
uses of color. [The sixteen settings here do the same as the sixteen settings
covered by the -Yk0 and -Yk switches.] The Elements group covers the colors
used for the four elements. [This does the same as the -YkC switch.] The Seven
Rays group covers the colors of the esoteric Rays. [This does the same as the
-Yk7 switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Show Interpretations:</span> This toggles whether or
not interpretations are given for text charts. [This does the same as the -I
switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Print Nearest Second:</span> This toggles whether or
not all zodiac positions are displayed to the nearest arc second as opposed to
just the arc minute. [This does the same as the 0 part of the -b0 switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Applying Aspects:</span> This toggles whether or not
aspect orbs are displayed in the form of about to happen or just happened, as
opposed to degrees narrow or degrees wide. [This does the same as the a part
of the -ga and -aa switches.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Parallel Aspects:</span> This toggles whether or not
aspects in the vertical plane are used, with the parallel and contraparallel
aspects shown as opposed to conjunction and opposition. [This does the same as
the p part of the -gp and -ap switches.]</p>

<p class=Section2>Info menu commands:</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Set Chart Info...:</span> This brings up the generic Enter
Chart Info dialog, which is the place for one to actually create a chart by
specifying the time and location in question. The dialog contains eight main
controls, for month, day, year, time, Daylight Saving Time flag, time zone,
longitude, and latitude. These have dropdowns from which one may optionally
choose common values. If the Print Nearest Second command is set, then times
and locations in this dialog will be displayed to the second, instead of just
to the minute. After this are two optional text edit controls where one may
enter the name and location for the chart. The special button Now will copy
the current time over all the fields. The special button Previous will copy
the contents of the last chart cast over the fields. [The eight main combo
controls cover the same fields as the -qb switch. The two text controls cover
the same fields as the -zi switch. The Now button does the same as the -n
switch. The Previous button does the same as using the -i set virtual
file.]</p>

<p class=A>This dialog also allows access to Astrologs atlas, allowing one to
easily lookup the longitude and latitude of cities. Astrolog can also do time
zone detection (including whether Daylight Saving Time is in effect or not) for
any date/time at any location in the world. :) The following four buttons in
the dialog allow accessing these features:</p>

<p class=B>Lookup City: This button will look up the current city, as set in
the Location field. The 14 best matches will be displayed in the dialog.
Afterward, you can click on the entry in the dialog you want, then click the
Apply Info button to apply the coordinates to the chart info. You can specify
just a city name, or use a comma to combine with a country/region name or its
two letter abbreviation, to restrict search to just that region. For USA and
Canada, states and provinces may be specified instead of or in addition to the
country. City names will match substrings, which will be ranked in an
appropriate manner. For example, if you lookup the city Eden, the exact match
Eden, NC will be first, followed by the subword exact match of Eden Prairie,
MN, then the substring match at the beginning/end of a word in Edenvale,
Germany, and finally the substring in the middle of a word Redencao, Brazil.
[This does the same as the -N switch.]</p>

<p class=B>Nearest Cities: This button will display the nearest cities to the
current longitude and latitude coordinates. The 14 nearest will be displayed in
the dialog. Again, you can click on the entry in the dialog you want, then
click Apply Info to apply the coordinates to the chart info. [This does the
same as the -Nl switch.]</p>

<p class=B>Time Changes: This button will display all time changes for the time
zone area corresponding to the active charts city in the Location string
field. This chart will display every time change to or from Daylight Time, as
well as occasions when the time zone offset itself for the location changes.
This will range from the first date when the location started using a standard
time zone (which will be no earlier than 1847 when GMT was introduced). The
list will run until 2025, or five years after the charts date (whichever is
later, but never later than 2080). Time changes will be printed one per line,
listing the date and local time at which the time changes, along with how the
time zone offset changes and how much the local clock time changes. [This does
the same as the -Nz switch.]</p>

<p class=B>Apply Info: This button will update the Time Zone, Daylight Saving,
Longitude, and Latitude fields in the chart appropriately, based on the local
time and city specified in the Time and Location fields. [This does similarly
as the -zN switch.]</p>

<p class=B>Note that some times are ambiguous, for which it is not possible to
determine whether or not Daylight Saving Time is in effect. For example, in
Seattle clocks fall back one hour on Nov 1, 2020, in which 1:59am Daylight
Time is followed by 1:00am Standard Time. If you say youre born at 1:30am
local time on that day, its unknown whether that means 1:30am Daylight Time,
or 1:30am Standard Time an hour later. Astrolog will display a warning in such
a situation. A similar warning will be displayed if you say you were born
during the one hour gap during which clocks spring ahead, which is an invalid
time that never appears on clocks because it gets skipped.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Chart For Now:</span> This sets the current chart
information to the current time now. [This does the same as the -n switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Default Chart Info...:</span> This brings up the
Default Chart Info dialog, in which one may specify the default Daylight
setting, time zone, the correction factor to add to now charts, longitude,
latitude, elevation above sea level, and name and location strings. These
settings are used in commands such as Chart For Now, in which the current time
obtained needs to be combined with some location to make a complete chart. [The
eight controls in this dialog correspond respectively to the -z0, -z, -Yz, the
two parameters passed to the -zl, the -zv, and the two parameters passed to the
-zj switches.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Set Chart #2 Info...:</span> This brings up a dialog
identical to the standard Chart Info dialog, except here the chart settings
specified are put into the second chart slot, as used in relationship charts.
This command is to Set Chart Info, as the Open Chart #2 command is to Open
Chart. [This does the same as the -i2 switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Charts #3 and #4...:</span> This brings up a dialog
giving one access to all four chart slots, with buttons which will bring up the
file open dialogs to load chart info into each slot, and buttons allowing
access to the chart info dialogs to view or change the info in each slot. This
dialog also has a radio button group to indicate what type of wheel and how
many chart rings to display: a single wheel, bi-wheel, tri-wheel, or
quad-wheel. [This covers the same as the -r3 and -r4 switches, and the -i3 and
-i4 switches.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>No Relationship Chart:</span> This and the remaining
eight commands on the Info menu specify the current relationship chart mode if
any, where the currently active mode has a check mark by it. This first command
turns any relationship mode off, where just a single chart is shown, with any second
chart ignored. [This does the same as the -r switch when invoked as _r.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Comparison Chart:</span> This sets the relationship
chart mode to dual comparison, where two charts are shown side by side, e.g.
the wheel chart becomes a bi-wheel, and aspect grids are between two sets of
planets. [This does the same as the -r0 switch, except it uses the two charts
already in memory as opposed to reading them from file.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Synastry Chart:</span> This does a synastry chart, a
single chart consisting of the second charts planets in the first charts
houses. [This does the same as the -r switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Composite Chart:</span> This does a composite chart, a
single chart consisting of all the midpoints between each object pair in the
two charts. [This does the same as the -rc switch.]</p>

<p class=N><span class=M>Time Space Midpoint Chart:</span> This does a midpoint
relationship chart, a single chart cast at the time and location half way
between those of the two charts. In other words, this replaces chart #1 with the
midpoint of chart #1 and #2. The original contents of chart #1 are stored in
the previous chart slot, and will be restored upon exiting this relationship
mode. After exiting this mode, the previous chart slot will contain the
information for the midpoint chart. [This does the same as the -rm switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Date Difference Chart:</span> This displays the span
of time between the two charts, given in all units from the nearest second to
the nearest year. [This does the same as the -rd switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Biorhythm Chart:</span> This displays a biorhythm
chart, for a person born at the time in the earlier of the two charts, for the
time in the other chart. [This does the same as the -rb switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Transit and Natal:</span> This sets a mode identical
to Comparison Chart above except that the transit restrictions will apply to
the second chart and the natal restrictions to the first, instead of the natal
restriction set to both. [This does the same as the -rt switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Progressed and Natal:</span> This sets a mode like Transit
And Natal above, except that the second chart actually shown (outer ring in
wheel charts) will be a chart made by progressing the first chart to the time
in the second. [This does the same as the -rp switch.]</p>

<p class=Section2>Setting menu commands:</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Sidereal Zodiac:</span> This toggles whether or not
the chart is cast with respect to the sidereal zodiac as opposed to the
tropical. [This does the same as the -s switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Heliocentric:</span> This toggles whether or not the
chart is cast with respect to the Sun for a heliocentric chart, as opposed to
the Earth in a standard geocentric chart. [This does the same as the -h switch
toggling between Sun and Earth centered charts.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>House System:</span> This submenu allows one to select
among 22 systems of house division to use. [This does the same as the -c
switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>House Settings:</span> This submenu allows one to
toggle various settings related to houses. The eight commands here are:</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Solar Chart:</span> This option toggles whether or not
the houses are rotated to put the Sun on the Ascendant for a solar chart. Note
that a check mark will be by this command when the houses are rotated any
amount, even if the focus object isnt the Sun and the position being rotated
to isnt the Ascendant. [This does the same as the -1 switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>3D Houses:</span> This option toggles whether house
placements are determined by 3D zodiac position and latitude coordinates,
instead of just a simple placement of zodiac position between house cusps.
[This does the same as the -c3 switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show Decans:</span> This option toggles whether or not
the planet positions are adjusted to put each object in the sign corresponding
to its decan. [This does the same as the -3 switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show Dwads:</span> This option toggles whether or not
the planet positions are adjusted to put each object in the sign corresponding
to its dwad. [This does the same as the -4 switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Flip Signs With Houses:</span> This option toggles
whether or not planet and house positions are swapped with respect to each
other for a Domal chart. [This does the same as the -f switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Geodetic Houses:</span> This option toggles whether or
not house cusps are only computed based on the charts longitude for geodetic
houses. [This does the same as the -G switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Vedic Wheel Display:</span> This option toggles
whether wheel charts are displayed in Vedic format or not. [This does the same
as the -J switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show Navamsas:</span> This option toggles whether or
not the planet positions are adjusted to generate a navamsa chart. [This does
the same as the -9 switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Aspect Settings...:</span> This brings up the Aspect Settings
dialog, allowing one to set various things related to each aspect. For each of
the 18 aspects, there is: (1) A checkbox for whether the aspect is to be
included in charts at all, (2) an edit control specifying the aspects maximum
orb, (3) an edit control specifying the aspects actual angle, (4) an edit
control specifying the aspects relative power for influence charts, and (5) an
control specifying the color to use when displaying the aspect. In addition
there are three buttons: (1) Restrict All which automatically checks all
aspects, (2) Unrestrict All which unchecks them all, and (3) Toggle Majors which
inverts the status of the first five aspects. [The checkboxes do the same as
the -A and -RA switches. The orb fields do the same as the -Ao or -YAo switches. The angle fields do the same as the -Aa switch. The influence fields do the
same as the -YjA switch. The color fields do the same as the -YkA switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Object Settings...:</span> This brings up the Object
Settings dialog, allowing one to set various things related to each planet. For
each of the first 20 objects, there is: (1) an edit control specifying the
maximum aspect orb allowed to that object, e.g. no more than a two degree orb
to the North Node, (2) an edit control specifying an aspect orb addition
allowed, e.g. widen all orbs by one degree for the Sun, (3) an edit control
specifying the objects relative power for influence charts, and (4) an edit
control specifying the color to use when displaying the object, which also
allows selecting Element or Ray to become the colors of the element of the
sign that the planet rules, or the Ray associated with the sign. [The max orb
fields do the same as the -Am or -YAm switches. The orb addition fields do the
same as the -Ad or -YAd switches. The influence fields do the same as the -Yj
switch. The color fields do the same as the -YkO switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>More Object Settings...:</span> This brings up a
dialog much like the Object Settings dialog above, except this dialog is for
the house cusp and Uranian objects. Like the standard Object Settings dialog
which is for the first 20 objects, this dialog allows one to set the maximum
aspect orb allowed to, the orb addition factor for aspects concerning, and the
power influence value of, each cusp and Uranian object. This dialog also has an
object labelled All Stars, which applies to all fixed stars equally.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Restrictions...:</span> This brings up the Object
Restrictions dialog, allowing one to specify whether each planet or other
object is included in charts, where each object has a checkbox, with checked
meaning restricted. In addition there are several buttons added for
convenience: (1) Restrict All which automatically checks all objects, (2) Unrestrict
All which unchecks them all, (3) Toggle Minors which inverts the state of
the asteroids and all the other objects in the second set of ten, (4) Toggle
Cusps which inverts the state of the 12 cusp objects, (5) Toggle Uran. which
inverts the eight Uranian planets, and (6) Copy From Transit Restriction Set which
sets all items to be the state of those in the parallel transit restriction
set. [This dialog does the same as passing values to the -R switch. The Restrict
All, Unrestrict All, Toggle Cusps, and Toggle Uran. buttons do the same
as the -R0, -R1, -RC and -Ru switches respectively.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Star Restrictions...:</span> This brings up the Star
Restrictions dialog, which is similar to the standard Restrictions dialog
except it deals with the fixed star or other deep space objects. Each of the 47
fixed stars has a checkbox, where in addition there are two buttons: (1)
Restrict All which automatically checks all the star objects, and (2)
Unrestrict All which unchecks them all. [The Restrict All and Unrestrict
All buttons do the same as the -RU0 and -RU1 switches.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Include Minors:</span> This toggles whether or not the
asteroids and other minor objects are included in charts. [This does the same
as the -R switch when invoked without any parameters.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Include Cusps:</span> This toggles whether or not
house cusps are included as objects in charts such as aspect grids and transit
searches. [This does the same as the -C switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Include Uranians:</span> This toggles whether or not
the Transneptunian planets are included in charts. [This does the same as the
-u switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Include Fixed Stars:</span> This toggles whether or
not stars are included in charts. [This does the same as the -U switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Transit Restrictions...:</span> This brings up the
Transit Restrictions dialog, which is identical the standard Restrictions
dialog in every way except it sets the status of the objects in the transit
restrictions array, as used in transit charts. The Copy From Standard
Restriction Set button here copies all flags from the standard restriction
set. [The various operations here do the same as the -RT switch and
derivatives.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Calculation Settings...:</span> This brings up the
Calculation Settings dialog, used to set various settings which affect zodiac
positions of objects. They are:</p>

<p class=B>(1) A dropdown for the calculation method, which (depending on
whats been compiled into the program) will allow one to calculate planet
positions by up to five different methods: Swiss Ephemeris, slightly less
accurate Moshier ephemeris, old and less accurate Placalc ephemeris, very old
and much less accurate Matrix formulas, or None [same as -b, -bs, -bp, and -bm
switches]. The Swiss Ephemeris selection will show which version of Swiss
Ephemeris is being used. When None is selected most objects will be placed at
0Aries, which of course isnt useful except for obscure testing scenarios.<br>
(2) An edit control to specify the zodiac degree offset or ayanamsa [same as
the parameter passed to the -s switch]. This control has a dropdown to allow
quick selection of several common systems of sidereal astrology. The values in
it are 0.0 for Fagan-Bradley, 0.883333 (or 0 degrees 53' and 0) for Nirmala
Chandra Lahiri [Robert Hand version], 0.98 (or 0 degrees 58' and 48) for
Krishnamurti, 2.329444 (or 2 degrees 19' and 46) for B.V. Raman, and -3.619166
(or -3 degrees 37 and 9) for Djwhal Khul.<br>
(3) The central planet, e.g. geocentric, heliocentric, or some other planet
[same as the parameter passed to the -h switch].<br>
(4) The harmonic chart factor [same as -x switch].<br>
(5) The dwad nesting level [same as -4 switch].<br>
(6) A checkbox indicating whether the North and South Node objects are the True
Node or the Mean Node [same as -Yn switch].<br>
(7) A checkbox indicating whether the four angular cusp objects are set to the
positions of the actual house as defined by the current house system [same as
-Yc switch].<br>
(8) A radio button group specifying the solar chart setting, i.e. whether to
rotate the house cusps so an object is on the Ascendant or on the Midheaven,
and an edit control specifying which object to use when active [all this does
the same as the -1 and -2 switches].<br>
(9) A checkbox in the solar chart group above indicating whether the Ascendant
or Midheaven should be rotated to the start of the objects sign [same as -10
and -20 switches].<br>
(10) A checkbox indicating whether to display planetary latitude positions
relative to Earths equator, as opposed to the ecliptic [same as -sr0 switch].<br>
(11) A checkbox indicating whether to display planetary longitude positions
relative to Earths equator, as opposed to the ecliptic as is standard in
astrology [same as -sr switch].<br>
(12) A checkbox indicating whether true instead of apparent positions are shown
[same as the -YT switch].<br>
(13) A checkbox indicating whether topocentric positions relative to ones
position on the surface of the Earth are shown [same as -YV switch].<br>
(14) A checkbox indicating whether sidereal zodiac positions are relative to
the plane of the solar system instead of the ecliptic [same as -Ys switch].<br>
(15) A checkbox indicating whether 3D houses are active, in which house
position determination takes into account planetary latitude [same as -c3
switch].<br>
(16) A checkbox indicating whether 3D aspects are active, in which aspect angle
determination takes into account planetary latitude [same as -A3 switch].<br>
(17) A checkbox indicating whether 3D orbs are active, in which aspect orbs are
applied to planetary latitude as well as longitude [same as -Ap switch].</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Display Settings...:</span> This brings up the Display
Settings dialog, used to set various settings that affect cosmetic changes in
chart displays. They are:</p>

<p class=B>(1) A checkbox indicating whether to round positions to the nearest
unit instead of crop [same as -Yr switch].<br>
(2) A checkbox indicating the date display format [same as -Yd switch].<br>
(3) A checkbox indicating the time display format [same as -Yt switch].<br>
(4) A checkbox indicating the distance display format [same as -Yv switch].<br>
(5) A checkbox indicating whether minor or equivalent aspects to house cusp
objects are dropped [same as -YC switch].<br>
(6) A checkbox indicating whether to leave off the rightmost characters of text
chart rows if they exceed the text columns setting [same as -Y8 switch].<br>
(7) Two checkboxes indicating whether to include sign and direction changes in
transit to transit searches [same as -YR0 switch].<br>
(8) An edit control indicating the reverse restriction, or a required object
that must be present in charts involving aspects between planets [same as -RO
switch].<br>
(9) A checkbox indicating whether to export text files in HTML format [same as
-kh switch].<br>
(10) A checkbox indicating whether to export text and print in an intuitive manner
[same as -YO switch].<br>
(11) A checkbox indicating whether to output chart info files in the old
non-command switch format used before version 4.20 [same as -Yo switch].<br>
(12) A checkbox indicating whether the screen as well as metafile and
PostScript graphics files should use system as opposed to simulated fonts for
glyphs and other characters [same as -YXf switch].<br>
(13) Two edit controls specifying the horizontal and vertical paper size in
inches to use in PostScript charts [same as -YXp0 switch]. Sizes may be
specified in inches or centimeters. If the parameter ends in cm then it will
be parsed as centimeters, and if it ends in in then it will be parsed as
inches. If theres no units, then it will be parsed based on the distance
display format setting above.<br>
(14) A radio button group indicating how to orient the paper for PostScript
charts [same as -YXp switch].<br>
(15) A radio button group specifying how to display zodiac positions, i.e. in
the standard degree/sign/minute notation, in hours/minutes, or just degrees
[these items correspond to the -sz, -sh, and -sd switches].<br>
(16) Five checkboxes to control whether standard rulerships, esoteric
rulerships, Hierarchical rulerships, exaltations, and Ray rulerships should
appear in charts [same as -YR7 switch].<br>
(17) Four checkboxes to control whether the events of rising, zenith transit,
setting, and nadir transit appear in the rising and setting chart [same as -YRZ
switch].<br>
(18) The number of aspects to include in charts [same as the -A switch].<br>
(19) The number of text columns to use in interpretation paragraphs [same as
the parameter passed to the -I switch].</p>

<p class=Section2>Chart menu commands:</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Standard Radix:</span> This sets the current chart
displayed to be the standard default radix or natal chart, i.e. a standard list

be a list of the positions of all Arabian part items for the given time, and is
a text mode only chart. [This does the same as the -P switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Rising and Setting:</span> This sets the current
display to be a list of the times during the day any planet rises, sets, and
crosses the meridian and nadir. This is a text mode only chart. [This does the
same as the -Zd switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Nearest Cities:</span> This sets the current display
to be a list of the nearest cities to the chart location in text mode, or will
draw a map of the local area of the world labeling visible cities in graphics
mode. [This does the same as the -Nl switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Transits...:</span> This brings up the Transits
dialog, used to create various transit lists. The first thing to do when using
this dialog is to set the type of chart desired in the transit type radio
button group. The five choices here are:</p>

<p class=B>(1) Transit to transit times, which will display exact times of
aspects and other events such as sign and direction changes over a range of
time [same as -d switch].<br>
(2) Transit to transit influence, which will display all aspects between
objects in the current chart ordered by significance [same as -D switch].<br>
(3) Transit to transit graph, which will for each aspect show a graph of its
orb strength over a range of time [same as -B switch].<br>
(4) Transit to natal times, which will display exact times of aspects made to
natal planets from transiting planets over a range of time [same as -t switch].<br>
(5) Transit to natal influence, which will display all aspects between transiting
and natal objects for a given time ordered by significance [same as -T switch].<br>
(6) Transit to natal graph, which will for each transit to natal aspect show
a graph of its orb strength over a range of time [same as -V switch].<br>
(7) None, which gets out of any transit chart mode.</p>

<p class=B>The second thing to do is to be aware of the progress instead of
transit checkbox; when checked, all the transit charts will instead be
progressed charts, i.e. the transit types will be:</p>

<p class=B>(1) Progressed to progressed times [same as -dp switch].<br>
(2) Progressed to progressed influence [same as -D combined with -p].<br>
(3) Progressed to progressed graph [same as -Bp switch].<br>
(4) Progressed to natal times [same as -tp switch].<br>
(5) Progressed to natal influence [same as -Tp switch].<br>
(6) Progressed to natal graph [same as -Vp switch].</p>

<p class=B>Now, for the transit to natal charts, you should set the values in
the transit to natal info combo control group (these controls are ignored for
the transit to transit charts). There are controls for month, day, year,
and time like those in the Chart Info dialog, which here set the time for the
transiting chart (the natal chart settings should of course be set in Chart
Info). Pressing the Now button in the dialog will set these time values to be
that of the current moment. In addition, for the transit to transit/natal times
and transit to transit/natal graph charts, you should select from the times
and graph cover radio button group appropriately (these controls are ignored
for the transit influence charts). In this group one may choose to scan over a
single day, a month, year, or range of years for aspects, where the time in
question is that surrounding the natal chart set in the Chart Info dialog for transit
to transit times/graph, and is the time surrounding that in the do transits
for group in this dialog for transit to natal times/graph. You should note
here that (1) when the range of years radio button is selected, the number of
years to scan over may entered in the years to span edit control (with this
setting being ignored otherwise), (2) the shortest period transit to natal times
may be done for is a single month, meaning that even if you select the given
day radio button in combination with this chart you'll get the given month,
and (3) that some of the time settings in the do transits for group are
effectively ignored when doing transit to natal times over a large range,
e.g. when doing the given year, the values in the month, day, and time controls
don't affect the chart any.</p>

<p class=B>Another checkbox named display transit returns only, will when
checked affect the transit to natal search chart so that it only shows
returns, and affect the transit to natal influence chart so that it only
shows aspects between a transiting planet and the same natal planet [same as
the -tr, -Tr, and -Vr switches]. Another checkbox named graphs include all
planets affects affects the transit to natal graph and transit to transit
graph charts, and causes them to not autorestrict certain fast moving planets
[same as the -B0 and -V0 subswitches]. Also for the two times charts, you can
change the value in the searching divisions edit control, which determines at
how narrow intervals to cast charts for, with higher values giving more
accurate times but taking longer to compute [this is the same as the optional
parameter passed to the -d switch].</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Progressions...:</span> This brings up the
Progressions dialog, which as its name suggests allows one to do various forms
of progressed charts. The first thing to do when using this dialog is to set
the Do Progression checkbox appropriately [same as -p switch]. When checked,
all standard charts Astrolog calculates will be progressed. When clear, all
charts will be normal which means the rest of the settings in the dialog are
ignored.</p>

<p class=B>Assuming progressions are being done, you then want to set the
values in the Progressed Chart Info combo control group. There are controls
for Month, Day, Year, and Time like those in the Chart Info dialog,
which here set the time to progress the natal chart to (the natal chart being
of course set in Chart Info). Pressing the Now button in the dialog will set
these time values to be the current moment.</p>

<p class=B>Next, you may set the values in the Progression Type control group
to define the type of progression to do. There is a radio button group which
one may use to select between Secondary (Calculated Cusps), Secondary (Solar
Arc Cusps) [same as -p1 switch], or Solar Arc [same as -p0 switch]. Also there
is a Degrees Per Day combo control which one may use to set the progression
speed [same as -pd switch]. A number may be typed in, or one of several common
values for this setting may be selected from the dropdown: The number 365.24219
here gives the standard year for a day rate, the number 131487.188 does
primary directions or a year per four minutes, while other values will do
tertiary progressions. Finally there is a Cusp Move Ratio field to define the
slowness factor to apply to progressed house cusps [same as -pC switch].</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Chart Settings...:</span> The brings up the Chart
Setting Details dialog, which defines various minor settings that go with and
affect the various displays. They are:</p>

<p class=B>(1) A checkbox indicating whether to display planet velocity values
relative to average speed in the text mode standard chart list [same as -v0
switch].<br>
(2) An edit control specifying the number of text rows to have in each house
for the text mode wheel chart [same as the parameter passed to the -w switch].<br>
(3) A checkbox indicating whether the text house wheel chart lists objects in
Western houses four through nine in reverse order [same as -w0 switch].<br>
(4) A checkbox indicating whether the text aspect grid lists all aspect
configurations (e.g. Grand Trines) after the grid [same as -g0 switch].<br>
(5) A checkbox indicating whether the relationship aspect grid shows midpoints
instead of aspects [same as -gm switch].<br>
(6) A checkbox indicating whether the text aspect list also gives a summary of
the number of aspects of each type and to each planet [same as -a0 switch].<br>
(7) A checkbox indicating whether the text midpoint list also gives a summary
of the number of midpoints in each zodiac sign [same as -m0 switch].<br>
(8) A checkbox indicating whether the text midpoint list also for each midpoint
gives a sublist of each aspect from a planet to it [same as -ma switch].<br>
(9) A checkbox indicating whether the local horizon chart is displayed with
respect to the poles, where in text mode the positions are given in prime
vertical coordinates, and in graphics mode centers the display around a view
looking straight up as opposed to at the horizon [same as -Z0 switch].<br>
(10) A checkbox indicating whether the Gauquelin sector chart is computed as a
fast approximation based on Placidus cusps [same as -l0 switch].<br>
(11) A checkbox indicating whether the text calendar chart is for the entire
year as opposed to just the month surrounding the time in the current chart.<br>
(12) A checkbox indicating whether the text influence chart also lists the
influence of each sign in the chart after the influences of all the planets
[same as -j0 switch].<br>
(13) An edit control specifying the degree interval at which longitude and
latitude coordinates are given for the curved Ascendant and Descendant lines in
the text astro-graph chart [same as the parameter passed to the -L switch].<br>
(14) A checkbox indicating whether the text astro-graph chart also lists all
latitude crossings between lines [same as -L0 switch].<br>
(15) A checkbox indicating whether the ephemeris chart is for the entire year
as opposed to just the month surrounding the time in the current chart.<br>
(16) An edit control specifying the number of Arabian parts to include in the
Arabic part chart [same as the parameter passed to the -P switch].<br>
(17) A checkbox indicating whether to display the formulas for the parts in the
Arabic part chart in A+C-B as opposed to A-B+C form [same as -P0 switch].<br>
(18) An edit control specifying the number of days covered by biorhythm charts [same
as -Yb command switch].<br>
(19) A radio button group which determines in what order to sort the fixed star
objects for charts such as the standard text listing [same as the letter if any
included with the -U switch].<br>
(20) A radio button group which determines in what order to sort the parts in the
Arabic part chart [same as the letter if any included with the -P switch].</p>

<p class=Section2>Graphics menu commands:</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Draw Chart Sphere:</span> This sets the current chart
displayed to be a chart sphere, which is like a standard chart wheel but in 3D.
[This does the same as the -XX switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Draw World Map:</span> This sets the current chart
displayed to be a map of the world displayed in rectangular form, including
plotting the zenith locations of planets and other astro-graph lines. [This
does the same as the -XW switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Draw Globe:</span> This sets the current display to be
the map of the world shown as the side view of a globe, which effectively makes
it a 3D astro-graph chart. Note that this chart looks nice in animation mode
because it rotates! [This does the same as the -XG switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Draw Polar Globe:</span> This sets the current display
to be the map of the world shown in polar projection with the North (or South)
pole in the center. [This does the same as the -XP switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Draw Telescope:</span> This sets the current display
to be a telescope view of a part of the sky, which may be focused upon a
particular planet. [This does the same as the -XZ switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Reverse Background:</span> This toggles whether or not
graphics charts are displayed black on a white background as opposed to the
standard white on a black background. This setting affects text mode charts in
addition to graphics charts, and allows text charts to be displayed on a white
background if one prefers. [This does the same as the -Xr switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Monochrome:</span> This toggles whether or not
graphics charts are displayed in just black and white monochrome mode as
opposed to in the standard selection of 16 VGA colors. [This does the same as
the -Xm switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Square Screen:</span> This resizes both the graphics
chart and the window to be square shaped, and is useful for charts such as the
wheel or globes if they ever appear oblong and not circular shaped as they
should. For wheel charts with sidebars it will logically make it so just the
wheel part becomes square.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Character Scale:</span> This submenu allows one to set
the size of the glyphs in graphics charts. For text mode charts, this setting
will affect the font size of the characters. There are four options on this
menu of Small, Medium, Large, and Huge, with medium being the default.
There are two more options on this menu labeled Decrease and Increase,
which will move the setting down or up a notch (if not already at an extreme).
[For graphics these settings correspond to the four percentage values that may
be passed to the -Xs switch.] Important note: I've found that some systems,
when changing the size of characters for text charts, don't seem to be able to
load the correct new font; if you notice characters overlapping each other at
small scales and the same size characters with lots of space between them at large
scales, opening up a DOS prompt seems to fix the problem.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Chart Effects:</span> This submenu allows one to
toggle various settings which determine whether things are displayed on the
almost all graphics charts. The five commands here are:</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show Border:</span> This toggles whether or not
graphics charts are displayed with borders around them. [This does the same as
the -Xu switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show Chart Info:</span> This toggles whether or not
graphics displays have the time and location of the chart in question printed
at their base. [This does the same as the -Xt switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show Info Sidebar:</span> This toggles whether or not
wheel charts are displayed with an information sidebar to their right, listing
the positions of the houses and objects along with element table summaries.
[This does the same as the -v0 switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show Glyph Labels:</span> This toggles whether or not
glyphs are drawn for planets and objects in graphics charts. Pretty much the
only time its useful to ever turn this off is for the local horizon and orbit
charts, especially when doing a timed exposure animation of them. [This does
the same as the -Xl switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show Glyphs On Aspect Lines:</span> This toggles
whether or not aspect lines between planets show aspect glyphs on them. [This
does the same as the -XA switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Map Effects:</span> This submenu allows one to toggle
various settings which control things on the sphere, map, and globe displays.
The six commands here are:</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show Constellations:</span> This toggles whether or
not the map displays show in them the astronomical constellations instead of
the continents of the world. [This does the same as the -XF switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show All Stars:</span> This toggles whether or not the
map displays show in them every fixed star defined in the sefstars.txt file.
[This does the same as the -XU switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show House Details:</span> This toggles whether or not
the map displays show in them the boundaries of the 12 houses. [This does the
same as the -XC switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show Equator:</span> This toggles whether or not the
map displays show in them the location of the Earths equator. [This does the
same as the -Xe switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Show Cities:</span> This toggles whether or not the
map displays plot in them the location of every city in the atlas. [This does
the same as the -XL switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Use Ecliptic Axis:</span> This toggles whether the
chart sphere, globe, and local horizon displays are aligned with the ecliptic.
[This does the same as the -YXe switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Map Orientation:</span> This submenu allows one to
change the angle of rotation and tilt of the Earth in the globe and related charts,
along with the zoom level which applies to certain charts. The first three menu
options here are: Tilt North, which pulls the globe down one degree (or
rather a number of degrees equal to the animation jump factor); Tilt South,
which pulls the globe up one degree; and Set to Zero, which returns the globe
to the standard zero degree angle with the equator edge on. [This affects the
same setting as the second optional parameter passed to the -XG switch.] The
next two menu options are: Rotate West, which rotates the globe to the right
one degree (or rather a number of degrees equal to the animation jump factor);
and Rotate East, which rotates the globe to the left one degree. [This
affects the same setting as the first optional parameter to the -XG switch.]
The final two menu options are: Zoom Out and Zoom In which double or halve
the amount of space visible in the solar system, nearest cities, and telescope
charts. [This affects the same setting as the -YXS switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Modify Display:</span> This toggles whether or not
each graphics chart is displayed in a slightly modified form, e.g. for the map
displays this will show just the map itself, and plot all the planets upon it. [This
does the same as the -Xi switch; see the documentation for this switch in an
earlier section for a list of how this setting affects each chart.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Modify Chart:</span> This option acts as a quick way
to toggle several settings associated with certain charts. They are:</p>

<p class=B>(1) For wheel charts, toggle between the standard wheel and the
house emphasized wheel.<br>
(2) For the relationship grid, toggle whether it shows midpoints instead of
aspects.<br>
(3) For the local horizon chart, toggle whether it displays with a polar
center.<br>
(4) For the astro-graph chart, toggle whether it draws a line across the world
map at the chart location.<br>
(5) For ephemeris and calendar charts, toggle whether theyre displayed for the
year instead of just the month.<br>
(6) For transit graphs, toggle whether they show all aspects instead of restricting
fast moving objects.<br>
(7) For chart spheres and globe displays, toggle which hemisphere they focus
upon.<br>
(8) For the world map display, toggle whether its shown in Mollewide
projection.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Scribble Color:</span> This submenu allows one to
select the color to use when using the mouse to draw on the window. It has
sixteen options, one for each of the main colors.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Graphics Settings...:</span> This brings up the
Graphics Settings dialog, used to set various additional bitmap settings not
already covered by menu options. They are:</p>

<p class=B>(1) Two edit controls specifying the horizontal and vertical size of
the graphics chart in pixels [same as -Xw switch].<br>
(2) An edit control specifying the scale size of glyphs in graphics charts,
with a dropdown allowing one to select from the four valid percentages 100
through 400 [same as -Xs switch].<br>
(3) An edit control specifying the scale size of text in graphics charts, with
a dropdown allowing one to select from the four valid percentages 100 through
400 [same as -XS switch].<br>
(4) A checkbox indicating whether charts that look best square should always be
drawn square, even in rectangular windows [same as the -XQ switch].<br>
(5) An edit control specifying the horizontal and vertical number of cells to
have in the graphic aspect grid chart, which may be zero to have the size
automatically determined [same as -YXg switch].<br>
(6) An edit control specifying the rotation in degrees for the globe and world
map charts [same as the first optional parameter passed to the -XG switch].<br>
(7) An edit control specifying the angular tilt in degrees for the globe chart
[same as the second optional parameter passed to the -XG switch].<br>
(8) A checkbox indicating whether to display the world map chart in the oval
shaped Mollewide projection as opposed to just in rectangular form [same as
-XW0 switch].<br>
(9) An edit control specifying the time to delay between doing screen updates
when in animation mode [same as the -WN switch].<br>
(10) A checkbox indicating whether animation mode affects the orientation of
map displays, instead of the time of the chart within the map [same as the -XN
switch].<br>
(11) An edit control specifying the planet to track and keep in the center of
the display (if any) in the telescope chart [same as the optional parameter
passed to the -XZ switch].<br>
(12) A checkbox indicating whether the graphics screen doesn't automatically update
and redraw after setting changes or window expose events, requiring the user to
manually force redraws [same as the -Wn switch].<br>
(13) A radio button group specifying the wheel chart rotation, i.e. whether
to rotate the entire wheel so an object is at the left edge or at the top edge
of the chart, and an edit control specifying which object to use when active
[all this does the same as the -X1 and -X2 switches].<br>
(14) A radio button group allowing one to select the decoration for the corners
of wheel charts, along with an edit control for how much of the image to cover
with it [same as the -YXv switch].<br>
(15) Four radio button groups allowing one to select between different glyphs
to use for Capricorn, Uranus, Pluto, and Lilith [same as -YXG switch].<br>
(16) Four radio button groups allowing one to select which font to use for
signs, houses, objects, and aspects [same as -YXf switch].</p>

<p class=Section2>Animate menu commands:</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Do Animation:</span> This starts animation, which
continually updates the static chart. The animation amount will be taken from
the values on the Jump Rate and Jump Factor submenus, which by default is to
continually Update To Now. Selecting this command when animation is already on
will toggle it off. Note that when animating the Transit And Natal or
Progressed And Natal bi-wheels (-rt and -rp switches) animating charts will
adjust the time of the transiting chart or the progressed chart, instead of the
natal chart. [This does the same as the -Xn switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Jump Rate:</span> This submenu allows one to select
the type of animation to do, when Do Animation is on. The first option, Update
To Now, sets it so the chart will be continuously updated to the current
moment, and will act as a glorified astrological clock. The remaining nine
options: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Months, Years, Decades, Centuries,
and Millennia, set it so whatever chart will step forward or backward by the
specified amount each update.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Jump Factor:</span> This submenu allows one to select
how many units of whatever time rate the animation proceeds by. The nine
options here are the numbers one through nine, where for example if animation
is jumping by Minutes above, selecting One will progress the chart by one
minute each update, and selecting Five will progress by five minutes each
update. This setting is ignored when animation is set to Update To Now or is
off altogether.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Reverse Direction:</span> This option toggles whether
or not animation will proceed backwards through time as opposed to forwards.
This setting has effect only when animation is on and set to an actual unit,
i.e. its ignored when set to Update To Now.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Pause Animation:</span> This toggles whether or not
any animation is paused. Animation being paused is basically the same as
animation being off altogether, except that its easy to unpause to continue
animating. Note that the pause key may be used in addition to the p key as a
keyboard shortcut to this command.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Timed Exposure:</span> This toggles whether or not the
screen is erased between each update. When active, the screen won't be cleared
meaning progressive updates are drawn over the existing display. This is
generally only useful for charts such as the local horizon or solar system
(with glyph labels off) where this effect may be used to create streaks showing
the path of objects across the sky or through their orbits. [This does the same
as the -Xj switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Step Forward:</span> This moves the time of the
current chart forward one day, or rather the number of units set in the Jump
Rate and Jump Factor menus. [This is similar to the -+ switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Step Backward:</span> This moves the time of the
current chart backward one day, or rather the number of units set in the Jump
Rate and Jump Factor menus. [This is similar to the -- switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Store Chart Info:</span> This copies the time and
location of the current chart being displayed and remembers it in a special
buffer. See below.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Recall Chart Info:</span> This sets the current chart
information to be that in the special buffer above. [This does the same as
using the -i set virtual file.]</p>

<p class=Section2>Help menu commands:</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Open Documentation:</span> This will show the large
comprehensive documentation file astrolog.htm that youre reading now, in the
default Web browser.</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>Documentation:</span> This submenu allows one to
access and even edit Astrologs documentation files online without having to
leave the program. The six commands here are:</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Open Defaults:</span> This will open the astrolog.as
default settings file in the Windows Notepad program.</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Open Documentation:</span> This will show the large
comprehensive documentation file astrolog.htm that youre reading now, in the
default Web browser.</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Open Changes:</span> This will open the changes.htm file
listing the additions to the current version over the previous one, in the
default Web browser.</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Open License:</span> This command launches the default
browser and has it automatically open the Astrolog license file license.htm,
displaying legal information on how you may use the program. Astrolog uses the
GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Open Website:</span> This will automatically visit the
Astrolog Web site. This command will start the default browser, and have it open
the file astrolog.url in the Astrolog install directory.</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Open Website Mirror:</span> This will open the
Astrolog website mirror location at magitech.com in the default browser, as
pointed to by the file astrlog2.url in the Astrolog install directory.</p>

<p class=N><span class=M>Setup:</span> Astrolog for Windows can do its own
setup in many respects. The five commands on this submenu are:</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Create Program Group (User):</span> This command will
create a Windows program group for the current user containing pointers to the
Astrolog executable, the main and update documentation files, and the Astrolog
website. [This does the same as the -WSg switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Create Program Group (All):</span> This command will
create the same program group, but for all users. [This does the same as the
-WSG switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Create Desktop Icon:</span> This command will create a
Windows desktop icon to launch Astrolog. [This does the same as the -WSd
switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Install File Extensions:</span> This command will

does the same as the -WSx switch.]</p>

<p class=B><span class=M>Uninstall File Extensions:</span> This command undoes
the effect of the previous command, and unassociates Astrolog from .as extension
files, which is useful for uninstall. Note the last two menu commands edit the
Windows registry, which is protected on Vista and newer versions of Windows,
meaning the command may fail and display an error message. Hence Astrolog may
need to be run as Administrator in order for the program to have permission to
change the registry. [This does the same as the -WSu switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>List Signs:</span> This sets the current display to be
a text listing of the twelve signs and houses and information about them. [This
does the same as the -HC switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>List Objects:</span> This sets the current display to
be a text listing of all the planets and other objects (that aren't restricted)
which Astrolog can compute the positions of, along with information about their
rulerships. [This does the same as the -HO switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>List Aspects:</span> This sets the current display to
be a text listing of all eighteen aspects the program can deal with, and
information about them. [This does the same as the -HA switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>List Constellations:</span> This sets the current
display to be a text listing of all 88 astronomical constellations the program
displays in the constellation map charts, and a little information about each
one. [This does the same as the -HF switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>List Planet Info:</span> This sets the current display
to be a text listing of the planets in the solar system, with some astronomical
data given about each. [This does the same as the -HS switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>List Rays:</span> This sets the current display to be
a text listing of the seven Rays, showing their names and associations with
signs and planets. [This does the same as the -H7 switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>List General Meanings:</span> This sets the current
display to be a text listing of the basic interpretation database used by the
program, giving the general meanings of each sign, house, planet, and aspect.
[This does the same as the -HI switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>List Switches:</span> This sets the current display to
be a text listing of the main command switches that may be passed to the
program, with a one line description of each. [This does the same as the -H
switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>List Obscure Switches:</span> This sets the current
display to be a text listing of the remaining more obscure command switches not
covered in the list above. [This does the same as the -Y switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>List Keystrokes:</span> This sets the current display
to be a text listing of the main shortcut keys (main being those that don't
require the Alt key and that exist in the DOS version as well) that one may
press to do various operations. [This does the same as the -HX switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>List Credits:</span> This sets the current display to
be a text listing of the credits and copyrights for the program. [This does the
same as the -Hc switch.]</p>

<p class=A><span class=M>About...:</span> This brings up the About Astrolog
dialog which contains static text also listing the credits and copyrights for
the program. Note that if you compile and run the debug version of the program,
the title bar of this dialog will have the text (DEBUG) added to it. [This
again contains the same text that the -Hc switch display prints.]</p>

</div>

<p class=A>AstroExpressions are programmable customizations that dont require
recompiling the program, and can be considered an extended form of command
switches. The term AstroExpression stands for Astrolog Expression. You can
compose expressions to do a variety of simple or advanced operations, such as
create your own house systems. AstroExpressions are composed of the following
components, which are defined as follows:</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Constant:</span> A fixed numeric value. For example,
True (which always evaluates to 1), and Signs (the number of signs in the
zodiac, which is 12). Indexes into the alphabet can be indicated by %a
(number 1) through %z (26). Also, there are lists of constants available for
months (1-12), objects, aspects, house systems, signs of the zodiac (1-12),
color indexes, and days of the week (0-6). These constants start with a letter
and an underscore, followed by at least three letters (or enough to be unique).
For example, M_January, O_Jupiter, A_Trine, H_Placidus, S_Leo,
K_Green, and W_Sunday.</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Variable:</span> A numeric value stored somewhere,
which can change. For example, Mon is the month of the current chart.</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Custom Variable:</span> One of a set of generic
variables, which dont correspond to any specific program setting, but can be
used by expressions to store whatever they want. An example is an index while
looping over the list of all objects. Some numeric variables are automatically
set by the program before it evaluates an AstroExpression hook, and can be
considered special parameters to that expression. Also, some custom variables
are automatically queried by the program after an expression hook returns, and
can be considered as special return values from that hook. The custom variable
slots start at index #0 and end at index #26. Custom numeric variables #0
through #9 can be referenced with the @ prefix (e.g. @0 or @9). Custom
variables #1 through #26 can also be referenced with @a through @z. Note the
important distinction between %a (which is always 1) and @a (which is the
value contained within variable #1).</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Parameter:</span> A piece of data passed to a function
or variable assignment. Parameters are either constants, variables, or
functions. Anything thats not a constant is a variable or function to be
queried or evaluated.</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Type:</span> The type of data contained in a parameter
or variable. All parameters and variables contain either integers or real
numbers. Integers are signed 32 bit numbers. Real numbers are floating point
numbers, and real constants always contain decimal points (e.g. 1.0 is real
number 1, while 1 is integer 1). Boolean values are no different from
integers, in which False is represented by 0, and True is represented by 1 or
any non-zero number. A hexadecimal integer can be specified with the #
prefix, and a binary integer can be specified with the ## prefix.</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Function:</span> A type of parameter, which evaluates
to a number. Functions are followed by zero or more nested parameters. An
example is Add, which takes two numeric parameters and returns their sum. A
function that takes zero parameters and always evaluates to the same thing is a
named constant, such as False or a specific color like K_Red. Functions
always precede their parameters, which means AstroExpressions are in prefix
format, e.g. Mul Add 1 2 Sub 4 3 expresses Multiply(Add(1, 2), Subtract(4,
3)) or (1 + 2) x (4 - 3).</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Expression:</span> A string of text which gets
evaluated, and returns a result. If an expression consists of multiple
subexpressions, they will be evaluated in sequence, and the value of the last
one will be returned. All parameters can be considered subexpressions contained
within a larger expression.</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Hook:</span> A type of expression that can be defined
which is hooked into a particular part of the program, which (if defined)
gets evaluated every time that part of the program runs. There are hooks into
object and house cusp calculation which can modify their positions, along with
hooks into certain charts which allow filtering or modifying their outputs.</p>

<p class=A>The following lists all AstroExpression functions. The name of each
function is listed, followed by the type of its return value and the expected
types of its parameters (if any). Numbers will automatically be converted to
Integer or Real as needed. Num means either type is handled, without any
conversion needed. If Num is the return value, then if any Num parameters
are Real the return type will be real, else integer. For example, Add 1 2.5
will cast integer 1 to real 1.0, then add two real numbers to return 3.5.
Bool means the function returns an integer (0 for False or 1 for True).</p>

midpoint grid, or sign of the object if referencing coordinates on the main
diagonal of a single chart grid.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>GridVal:</span> Int(IntX, IntY): Grid value. Returns
the orb value present in the current aspect grid, or degree within sign of the
midpoint if a midpoint grid, or degree within sign of the object if referencing
coordinates on the main diagonal of a single chart grid. Either way, return
value is number of arc-seconds.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Context:</span> Int: Chart context. Returns what the
current or most recently cast chart was cast for. This is usually 1-4 to
indicate which chart in a relationship or wheel is being cast. It can also be 0
for special case charts (like the chart cast for a progressed time), or -1 for
one of many charts cast in sequence (like each interval during a transit
search). This is designed for use in the ~q notification or hooks like ~O that
take place during chart casting.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Version:</span> Real: Program Version. Returns the
version of Astrolog running, which is 7.10.</p>

<p class=A>Programming functions (which are related to programming and control
flow):</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Var:</span> Num(Int): Variable lookup. Returns the
value within the referenced custom variable.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Do:</span> Num(Num1, Num2): Evaluate the parameter
Num1, then return Num2. Do is useful as the function inside control flow
functions such as If and For, to chain multiple operations together.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Do2:</span> Num(Num1, Num2, Num3): Evaluate the
parameters Num1 and Num2, then return Num3.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Do3:</span> Num(Num1, Num2, Num3, Num4): Evaluate the
parameters Num1 through Num3, then return Num4.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>If:</span> Num(Int, Num): If statement. If Int is
true, then evaluate Num. Returns Num if true, else 0. Note that Num will only
be evaluated if Int is true. Like the if statement in C.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>IfElse:</span> Num(Int, Num1, Num2): If/else. If Int
is true, then evaluate and return Num1, otherwise evaluate and return Num2.
Note that unlike the similar ?: function, here only one of Num1 and Num2 will
be evaluated. Like the if / else statement in C.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DoCount:</span> Num(Int, Num): Loop. Evaluate
expression Num for Int number of times in sequence. Return the final evaluation
of Num (or 0 if it never got evaluated).</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>While:</span> Num(Int, Num): While loop. Evaluates Int
as an expression. If true, evaluates Num and then repeats. Keep reevaluating
until expression Int is no longer true. Return the final evaluation of Num (or
0 if it never got evaluated). Warning: Expressions like While True 0 will run
forever and hang the program! Like the while statement in C.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DoWhile:</span> Num(Int, Num): Do/while loop.
Evaluates Num as an expression, then evaluates Int as an expression. If true,
then evaluate again, and repeat until expression Int is no longer true. Return
the final evaluation of Num. Like the do/while statement in C.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>For:</span> Int(Int1, Int2, Int3, Num): For loop. Set custom
variable indicated by Int1 to Int2. While Int1 is less than or equal to Int3, evaluate
Num, then increment Int1. Returns the final value of Int1 after the loop
finishes. In most cases one wants to specify the variable Int1 as %a instead
of @a. The former makes variable %a itself loop, while the latter makes the
custom variable pointed to by the value of @a loop. Similar to the for loop
in various languages.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Macro: </span>Num(Int). Macro expression. Run and
return the result of custom expression that was defined in slot Int with the ~M
command switch. AstroExpression macros will evaluate all expressions in
sequence and return the result of the last one, similar to AstroExpression
strings assigned to command switch hooks.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Switch:</span> Int(Int): Switch macro. Runs the
command switch macro, as defined with the -M0 switch. Returns whether running
that macro succeeded. Remember that a command switch macro (running a saved
command line) is different from an AstroExpression macro (which evaluates a
defined AstroExpression).</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>RndSeed:</span> Int(Int): Random seed. Initializes the
random number generation seed used by the Rnd function to an integer. Returns 0
always.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Assign:</span> Num(Int, Num): Variable assignment.
Assigns Num to the custom variable Int, and also returns that number. Can also
use = as a shortcut for Assign. </p>

<p class=B><span class=W>=a:</span> Num(Num): Assign to A. Assigns Num to
custom variable A, and also returns that number. Can also use functions =b
through =z to assign to them.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>_A3, _Ap, _AP0, _b, _b0, _c, _c3, _s, _s0, _sr, _sr0,
_h, _p, _p0, _pd, _pC, _x, _1, _3, _4, _f, _G, _J, _9, _YT, _YV, _Yh, _Ym, _Ys,
_Yn, _Yn0, _Yu, _Yr, _YC, _YO, _Yc, _Yp:</span> Bool or Int or Real: Program
setting. This list of functions queries the Astrolog program setting thats set
with the identically named command switch. There are only a few exceptions or
alternate behaviors: Function _AP0 is a Boolean for the -AP switch setting, and
includes a 0 in its name to avoid a case insensitive name conflict with _Ap.
Function _s is a boolean for the -s switch sidereal setting, while _s0 is a
real for the zodiac offset ayanamsa. Function _1 is non-zero if either the -1
or -2 solar chart switches are set, and contains (1+object focused upon) if -1
switch, and (-1-object) if -2 switch.</p>

<p class=A>There are various command switches which allow one to define
AstroExpression hooks into areas of chart calculation or display, to modify
or filter their results. All AstroExpression related command switches start
with the tilde ~ character. Note on Unix systems the shell automatically
expands ~ to your $HOME directory, so on them specify -~ (dash tilde) or
/~ (slash tilde) instead of just ~, to make it work.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~ &lt;string&gt;:</span> Display AstroExpression. The
passed in string will be parsed and evaluated, and the return value displayed.
This is useful for debugging expressions, or querying the value of custom
variables. It can also be used to debug complex command lines, by inserting
instances of ~ at appropriate points to display the current values of chart
information or other internal variables. For example, <span class=Y>~ 'Sqr Div
9.0 4.0'</span> will evaluate and display the expression SquareRoot(9.0 /
4.0) which is 1.5.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~v &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust object ordering.
Called each time a chart is cast, and allows changing the order in which
objects are listed in charts. This affects all lists of objects, including
aspect grids. On entry, custom variable @z is both the object index and its
default ordering. Return value is ignored, although if @z is changed it will be
the new ordering to use (ties are broken in favor of the object with the earlier
index). For example, to always display Ceres between Mars and Jupiter (instead
of after all the main planets) do: <span class=Y>~v &quot;If Equ @z O_Cer =z
O_Mar&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~g &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter aspect
configurations. Called for each aspect configuration in the -g0 aspect chart.
Return value is whether to display that aspect configuration. On entry, @v is
the aspect configuration (0=3 planet Stellium, 1=Grand Trine, 2=T-Square,
3=Yod, 4=Grand Cross, 5=Cradle, 6=Mystic Rectangle, 7=4 planet Stellium). Also,
@w through @z are the four planets involved (@z will be -1 if the configuration
only involves 3 planets). For example, to only display grand crosses and grand
trines, do: <span class=Y>~g &quot;Or Equ @v 1 Equ @v 4&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~a &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust aspect powers. Called
during the -a switch aspect list chart, and allows one to adjust each aspects
power. On entry, custom variables @w and @y are the two objects forming aspect,
@x is the aspect, and @z is the current power (in thousandths, e.g. a power of
1.234 is integer 1234). Return value is ignored, although if @z is changed it
will be the new power to use. For example, to triple the power of any aspect
involving an object in the sign Sagittarius, do: <span class=Y>~a &quot;If Or Equ
LonSign ObjLon @w S_Sag Equ LonSign ObjLon @y S_Sag =z Mul @z 3&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~a0 &lt;string&gt;:</span> Notify aspect list summary.
Called once after the -a0 aspect list summary is displayed. On entry, @y is the
total number of aspects that were displayed, and @z is the total power of all
aspects. Return value is ignored. For example, if you animate a bunch of aspect
list charts, you can keep track of the highest total power displayed (i.e.
store it in custom variable @a) with: <span class=Y>~a0 &quot;If Gt @z @a =a
@z&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~m &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter midpoints. Called for
each midpoint in the -m midpoint chart. On entry, @w and @x are the two objects
forming the midpoint, @y is the position of the midpoint, and @z is the angular
difference between their positions. Returns value is whether to display that
midpoint. For example, to only display midpoints located within 30 degrees of
the Suns position, do: <span class=Y>~m &quot;Lt LonDist @y ObjLon O_Sun
30.0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~ma &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter aspects to
midpoints. Called for each aspect made to a midpoint (or Arabic part) in the
-ma midpoint list. On entry, @v is the zodiac degree position of the midpoint,
@w is its velocity, @x is the aspect being made, @y is the object being
aspected, and @z is the orb between them. Return value is whether to display
that aspect. For example, to only display tight aspects to the Sun or Moon, do:
<span class=Y>~ma &quot;And Lt Abs @z 2.0 Lte @y O_Moo&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~L &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter latitude crossings.
Called for each latitude crossing in the -L0 astrocartography chart. On entry,
@u and @v are the longitude and latitude of the crossing point, @w and @y are
the two planets whose lines are involved, and @x and @z are object indexes for
angles indicating which lines are involved. For example, to only display
latitude crossings involving the Ascendant within 10 degrees of the current
charts latitude do: <span class=Y>~L &quot;And Lt Abs Sub @v Lat1 10 Or Equ @x
O_Asc Equ @z O_Asc&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~E &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter ephemeris output.
Called for each line in the text ephemeris chart. Return value is whether to
display the line. For example, to do a stellium search and only display
ephemeris lines in which there are at least 5 planets in the same sign, do: <span
class=Y>astrolog -n -Ey ~E &quot;For %m 1 Signs = @m 0 For %m 0 Objs If ObjOn
@m = LonSign ObjLon @m Inc Var LonSign ObjLon @m =n 0 For %m 1 Signs =n Max @n
Var @m Gte @n 5&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~P &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter Arabic parts. Called
for each Arabic part in the -P parts list chart. On entry, @y is the index of
the Arabic part (independent of the current sorting order), and @z is the
zodiac position of that part. Return value is whether to display that part. If
@z is changed, the parts position will be updated. For example, to only
display parts that lie in the 10th house, do: <span class=Y>~P &quot;Equ
LonHouse @z 10&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~d &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter transit to transit
events. Called for each event in the -d switch chart. On entry, @u is the first
object forming the event, @v is the aspect or other event (-1: sign change, -2:
direction change, -3: degree change), @w is the second object forming the event
(or new sign if that event), @x is Moon void of course indicator for how many
seconds it will be v/c (-1 for not going v/c in this event), @y is the eclipse
type (-1: eclipse detection turned off, 0: no eclipse, 1: penumbral, 2: total
penumbral, 3: partial, 4: annular, 5: total), and @z is the eclipse percentage
(if any). Return value is whether to display the event. For example, to display
eclipses for this year (at least those in effect when corresponding aspect is
exact) do: <span class=Y>astrolog -n -dy =Yu ~d &quot;Gt @y 0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~t &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter transit to natal
events. Called for each event in the -t switch chart. On entry, @x is the first
object forming the event, @y is the aspect (or -4 for 3D house change), @z is
the second object forming the event (or destination house if 3D house change).
Return value is whether to display the transit. For example, to only display
transit events taking place on weekends, do: <span class=Y>~t &quot;=a DayWeek
Mon Day Yea Or Equ @a 0 Equ @a 6&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~j &lt;string&gt;: </span>Filter influence powers.
Called when a charts object and aspect powers are computed in the text mode -j
influence and -7 esoteric charts. On entry, @x is the object, @y is its power
due to positioning, and @z is its power due to aspects. Return value is
ignored, although if you update @y and @z they will be the new powers used. For
example, to give an extra 100 power to completely unaspected planets, do: <span
class=Y>~j &quot;=n 0 For %i 0 Objs If And Neq @i @x GridNam Min @i @x Max @i
@x =n Inc @n If Lte @n 0 =z Add @z 100.0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~O &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust object position.
Called each time a chart is cast, and allows changing objects positions. On
entry, @v is the object index, @w is the objects zodiac position, @x is the
objects ecliptic latitude, @y is the objects zodiac position velocity
(negative for retrograde), and @z is the objects vertical velocity. Return
value is ignored, although if you update @w through @z the objects positions
and velocities will be updated. For example, to invert all zodiac positions 180
degrees for locations south of the equator, do: <span class=Y>~O &quot;=w Add
@w 180.0 Lt Lat 0.0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~C &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust house cusp position.
Called each time a chart is cast, and allows changing house cusp positions. On
entry, @x is the house cusp (1-12), @y is the cusps zodiac position, and @z is
the cusps 3D house position. Return value is ignored, although if @y and @z
are changed the cusps positions will be updated. For example, Astrolog
supports Null houses or the 0 Aries system, an equal house system in which
the 1st house cusp is always 0Aries. Suppose you want a 0 Leo house system in
which the 1st house cusp is always 0Leo? This can be done with: <span class=Y>~C
&quot;=y Mul Sub Add S_Leo @x 2 30.0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~A &lt;string&gt;:</span> Redefine aspect orb. Called
for each cell whenever the aspect grid is internally composed. On entry, @v and
@x are the two objects potentially being aspected, @w is the aspect, @y is the
difference in angle between them (negative for applying and positive for
separating), and @z is the default max orb. Return value is ignored, although
if @z is changed it will be the new max orb to use. For example, to have
separating aspects have 70% the orb of applying aspects, do: <span class=Y>~A
&quot;If Gt @y 0.0 =z Mul @z 0.70&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~p[0] &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust progression. The
~p string AstroExpression is called whenever a chart is about to be secondary
progressed, and the ~p0 string is called whenever a chart is about to be solar
arc progressed. (Mixed progressions that do solar arc for cusps and secondary
for planets will call both.) On entry, @x is the Julian time of the natal
chart, @y is the Julian time to use for progressed house cusps (which may be
different from planets if the -pC switch cusp move ratio is set), and @z is the
Julian time to use for progressed planets. Return value is ignored, although @z
(and also @y for ~p) can be modified to change the progressed results. For
example, to have progressions move at a logarithmic rate (fast early in life,
and continually slowing down over time) in the manner presented by A.T. Mann,
do: <span class=Y>~p0 &quot;If Gte @x @y =z Sub Mul Log10 Add Div Div Sub @x @y
365.25 0.076661459 10 120 120&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~kO &lt;string&gt;:</span> Customize object color.
Called each time an object glyph is displayed, and allows one to change its
color. On entry, @y is the object, and @z is the default color. Return value is
ignored, although if @z is changed it will be the new color to use. For
example, to make planets colored the same as the zodiac sign theyre located
within, do: <span class=Y>~kO &quot;=z ObjCol Dec Add O_Asc LonSign ObjLon
@y&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~kA &lt;string&gt;:</span> Customize aspect color.
Called each time an aspect line is drawn between two planets in a wheel chart,
and allows one to change its color. On entry, @w and @y are the two objects
being aspected, @x is the aspect, and @z is the default color. Return value is
ignored, although if @z is changed it will be the new color to use. For
example, to change the color of aspect lines involving the Sun or Moon to
magenta, do: <span class=Y>~kA &quot;If Or Lte @w O_Moo Lte @y O_Moo =z K_Mag&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~q[1-2] &lt;string&gt;:</span> Notify chart cast. The
~q1 string AstroExpression is called whenever a chart is about to be cast, and
the ~q2 string is called whenever a chart has just been cast. This is designed
to be used along with other AstroExpression hooks that adjust chart casting,
when theres initialization or finalization code needed. (For example, when the
~O hook is called, it cant tell whether its the first or last object being
adjusted.) </p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~Q[1-2] &lt;string&gt;:</span> Notify chart display.
The ~Q1 string AstroExpression is called whenever a chart is about to be
displayed, and the ~Q2 string is called whenever a chart has just been
displayed. This is designed to be used along with other AstroExpression hooks
that adjust chart display, when theres initialization or finalization code
needed.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~M &lt;0-26&gt; &lt;string&gt;:</span> Define
AstroExpression macro: Similar to command switch macros, you can define custom
AstroExpression macro functions. The first parameter is the macro slot to fill,
and the second is the AstroExpression to place within it. Macros can be called
in AstroExpressions with the Macro &lt;arg&gt; function, in which parameter
&lt;arg&gt; is the macro index to call.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~1 &lt;string&gt;:</span> Run expression. This simply
parses the string as an AstroExpression, and does nothing else. This is very
similar to the ~ switch except that also displays the final result. This
switch is good to use in a command switch file (to for example initialize
custom AstroExpression variables) when you dont want popup messages
interrupting anything.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>~0:</span> Disable AstroExpressions. AstroExpressions
are often hooks inserted into program operation, which means they may be
evaluated on every screen update. Therefore, they automatically get disabled if
theres an error parsing one, to avoid a continuous stream of errors. The ~0
switch disables all AstroExpression hooks in the current program session, which
means _~0 can be used to reenable them. This setting will also disable the
display of the result when using the ~ switch, although not any side effects of
its evaluation (which is useful to e.g. initialize custom variables in switch
files without getting popup windows). In the Windows version, the Enter
Command Line dialog has a Enable AstroExpression Hooks checkbox, which can
be used to enable, disable, or check their status.</p>

<p class=N>One final feature is that parsing of many dialog fields and command
switches can use AstroExpressions. If the parameter starts with a tilde (~)
character, then the rest of it will be parsed as an AstroExpression. For
example, to find and restrict the first unrestricted object, do: <span class=Y>-R
&quot;~=b 0 For %a 0 Objs If ObjOn @a Do =b @a =a Objs @b&quot;</span></p>

<p class=Section><a name=compile>COMPILING INSTRUCTIONS</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Compiling Astrolog is very similar to the process of compiling most
other programs: First edit the top of the file astrolog.h, commenting out any
of the #defines which set various features that aren't valid on your system or
you don't want, and changing default values and directories to your preference.
(Just see the self-explanatory section comments in this file.) Then in the same
manner, also edit these default parameter values in the astrolog.as file to
your liking, at least the location and time zone values. (I also recommend
turning on the Ansi color feature if your system will support it, since text
charts look much nicer in color.)</p>

<p class=A>For Unix systems, just run the command make in the directory
containing the file Makefile. You can also always compile by hand with a
command line like: cc -O -c *.cpp; cc -o astrolog *.o -lm -lX11. Just make
sure to compile each source file and link them together at the end with the
math library, and if applicable the X11 library. If compiling with GNUC, also
add -ldl to the linker line. Note that some Macs support X Windows, so modern
Macs can compile using this method too.</p>

<p class=A>It is possible to compile Astrolog on a VMS system, even with its X
windows functionality. Theres an example of a simple VMS .COM file in the
source code distribution which can automatically compile and link Astrolog on
VMS, which should work for the current version, although you might need to
include /noopt after the CCs since some compilers may cause the program to
pass parameters incorrectly with optimization on.</p>

<p class=A>To compile the Astrolog source code for Windows, the #define WIN
compile time flag needs to be uncommented in astrolog.h (this should of course
be commented out for all other platforms). In addition, the PC flag should be
uncommented, while the flags for other graphics libraries like X11 should be
commented out. Pretty much all of the features in the features section should
be on, such as INTERPRET, as well as some of the system settings like TIME,
because there are menu options that deal with them that won't automatically
disappear if theyre disabled. The included file Astrolog.vcproj may be used as
a project file or makefile. Ensure Project / Astrolog Properties /
Configuration Properties / Linker / System / Subsystem is set to Windows
(/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS) so it will be compiled as a Windows program. Also
manually add shlwapi.lib to the Project / Astrolog Properties / Configuration
Properties / Linker / Command Line / Additional Options area, because it may
not be automatically detected based on #include files. If you want the C
runtime to be statically linked instead of requiring the right runtime DLL to
be present, then set Project / Astrolog Properties / Configuration Properties
/ C/C++ / Code Generation / Runtime Library to Multi-threaded (/MT) instead
of Multi-threaded DLL (/MD). The standard Windows executable was compiled as
a 32 bit application using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. Other Windows
compilers should work, provided they have a resource compiler which understands
the standard .rc extension resources for menus and dialogs. Astrologs source
code can compile 64 bit instances of the Windows version too. The Windows About
dialog and the -Hc switch display will indicate whether a 32 or 64 bit version
of the program is running. Internally, the sources look for the compiler set
#define _WIN64 to indicate 64 bit specific content.</p>

<p class=A>To compile a command line only interface (CLI) version of Astrolog
on Windows, turn off WIN in astrolog.h before compiling. Also in Project /
Astrolog Properties / Configuration Properties / Linker / System, set
Subsystem to Console (instead of Windows which starts with the standard
Windows GUI).</p>

<p class=A>The command line only version of Astrolog on Windows can also bring
up a generic window with the -X switch, when the WCLI #define is uncommented
when compiling. This is different from the standard Windows version (which is a
full windowed program and not a command line program). The WCLI window wont
have a menu bar, but it will still accept keypresses and mouse clicks. Its
basically a Windows version of the X11 and Mac graphics versions, just compiled
for Windows instead of those alternate platforms. The WCLI version is more
limited, but useful for testing the generic window source code of the program
without having to go to different platforms.</p>

<p class=A>--</p>

<p class=A>Astrolog is officially supported and runs on classic Macintoshes.
The ready to run Mac executable for versions 5.40 and before were distributed
in a BinHex 4.0'ed self extracting archive. To unpack it, use a utility that
can un-BinHex such files to generate the self extracting archive, and then
double click the archive program to unpack the executable, documentation, and
other such files. I used CompactPro 1.34 to create the Mac archive, a useful
utility that can also BinHex and un-BinHex files. The executable should run on
most any 68K processor Mac, and will run on PowerMacs in emulation mode. It
requires 750K of heap to run, with 1.5M preferred.</p>

<p class=A>The Mac Astrolog executable has the same icon as the PC version, a
ringed planet with tilted red rings and surrounding stars, except the planet
body is tan (gray in four bit color mode) instead of yellow. It and the other
files are unpacked into their own Astrolog 5.40 folder, where the folders
icon has the same ringed planet overlaying it. When the program is actually
run, you'll be prompted to enter command switches in a terminal window. There
aren't many options available on the Mac menu bar, although you can File Quit
and copy selected text to the clipboard with it. The window doesn't have scroll
bars for when text runs off the top of the screen, but the -YQ pager will
prompt you to press return to continue scrolling if needed, and the -os switch
can be used to send all the output to a file in your Astrolog folder. When the
program terminates, the window title will prompt you to press return one more
time to exit before the window actually goes away.</p>

<p class=A>The program can read from the default settings file, and will use ephemeris
files for accurate calculations if -b is in effect. These and chart info files
are the same and fully compatible with such files from PC and Unix versions.
All files must however be in the Astrolog folder for the program to find them.
The -n chart for now switch will work accurately provided the current time and
zone are set up correctly in the Control Panels. The -k Ansi text feature does
exist in Mac Astrolog, but the terminal won't be able to display the control
codes properly, so this isn't really useful unless the output is sent to a file
and later displayed in an environment that understands the codes and can show
the colored text.</p>

<p class=A>Astrologs source code can be compiled and run on the classic
Macintosh perfectly with no special modifications needed. In making the
official Mac executable for version 5.40, I used the compiler Symantec C/C++
7.0 for the Mac. When compiling, uncomment the MACOLD compile time option in
astrolog.h, turn on the far data flag in the compiler, and make sure the ANSI
library is set to be loaded. Other Astrolog compile time option settings should
be SWITCHES off, ENVIRON off, and PROTO off. For Mac graphics, uncomment the
MACG compile time setting in astrolog.h, and make sure the MacTraps library
is set to be loaded. Note that modern Macs support X11, in which case this
entire section should be ignored, and the Unix version with X Windows support
should be compiled instead for the Mac.</p>

<p class=A>The Mac version of Astrolog also supports on-screen graphics, in
addition to the ability to create graphic bitmap, metafile, and PostScript
files on disk which may be viewed in another program. The -X switch will bring
up a separate window with the appropriate wheel or whatever other chart
displayed in it, and can press keys while the window is up to change or alter
the display. This makes the Mac version more or less equivalent in
functionality to the X Windows version, although a few things such as mouse
scribbles on the screen and flicker free updates aren't available. In the
source code, theres a compile time option in the astrolog.h file called MACG.
When set, it will compile in the Mac screen graphics. When commented out, it
will be like before. The MACG define is like the X11 compile time variable
which turns on screen graphics for a different platform.</p>
