<p class=FA>                         **  VERSION 7.00  **</p>

<p class=FA>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=A>Release notes for Astrolog version 7.00 (June 2020):</p>

<p class=A>Happy Full Moon Lunar Eclipse everyone! :) This file describes the
freeware astrology software program Astrolog version 7.00 and the additions and
fixes made to it, over the previous version 6.50 which was released eleven
months ago in July 2019. The main things in this update are an atlas (including
time zone and Daylight Time change information), eclipse detection, display of
numerous asteroids at once, Windows context menus, and “AstroExpressions” which
are programmable customizations that don’t require recompiling the program.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=feature>NEW FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are new additions to version 7.00 that weren't in previous
versions:</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>1. Atlas features:</span> Astrolog now has an atlas,
allowing one to easily lookup the longitude and latitude of cities. :)</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>Lookup city:</span> The new -N switch will look up the
current city (as set in the second parameter to the -zi switch, or the
“Location” field in the Chart Info dialogs). By default the 22 best matches are
displayed, although the switch takes one optional parameter for how many rows
to potentially display, which may range up to 200. In the Windows version, the
new “Lookup City” button in the Chart Info dialogs will do the same thing.
Afterward, you can click on the entry in the dialog you want, then click the
new “Apply Info” button to apply the coordinates to the chart info. (This will
also apply the correct time zone and Daylight Saving field too, as described
below). You can specify just a city name, or use a comma to combine with a
country/region name or its two letter abbreviation, to restrict search to just
that region. For USA and Canada, states and provinces may be specified instead
of or in addition to the country. City names will match substrings, which will
be ranked in an appropriate manner. For example, if you lookup the city “Eden”,
the exact match “Eden, NC” will be first, followed by the subword exact match
of “Eden Prairie, MN”, then the substring match at the beginning/end of a word
in “Edenvale, Germany”, and finally the substring in the middle of a word
“Redencao, Brazil”.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>Nearest cities:</span> The new -Nl switch will display
the nearest cities to the current longitude and latitude coordinates. By
default the 22 nearest are displayed, although the switch takes one optional
parameter for how many rows to display, which may range up to 200. In the
Windows version, the new “Nearest Cities” button in the Chart Info dialogs will
do the same thing.</p>

<p class=B>Atlas information is stored in the new file atlas.as, which gets
loaded the first time atlas information is needed. This is an Astrolog command
switch text file like any other, and can easily be user modified or extended.
The header of the file describes the format. The file consists of one instance
of the new -YY command switch, which takes one parameter indicating the number
of city location lines that follow in the file. This switch is only valid in
switch files, and an error will be displayed if it’s seen on the command line.</p>

<p class=B>The default atlas.as file contains over 24,000 cities, or every city
in the world with over 15,000 population. Similar to ephemeris files, you can
download a larger atlas if you want more cities available. The file <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/atlas/atlasbig.as">http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/atlas/atlasbig.as</a>
contains nearly 200,000 cities, or every city in the world with over 500
population. You can replace the default atlas.as with atlasbig.as, or just load
the larger file into the program when needed. The information in these atlases
was composed using data from <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">https://www.geonames.org/</a>,
available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>2. Time change features:</span> Astrolog can now do
time zone detection (including whether Daylight Saving Time is in effect or
not) for any date/time at any location in the world. :)</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>Apply time changes:</span> The new -zN switch takes
one parameter for a city name, and will automatically look it up, take the best
match, and apply to the chart info the atlas coordinates, time zone, and
whether Daylight Time is in effect. For example, “astrolog -qt Jun 5 2020 12:12pm
-zN Seattle” is a quick way to do a chart for that city given the date and
local time. In the Windows version, the “Apply Info” button in the Chart Info
dialogs will (after you select a city from lookup results) update the Time Zone
and Daylight Saving fields in the chart appropriately, based on the local time
and city you’ve specified in the Time and Location fields.</p>

<p class=B>Note that some times are ambiguous, for which it is not possible to
determine whether or not Daylight Saving Time is in effect. For example, in
Seattle clocks “fall back” one hour on Nov 1, 2020, in which 1:59am Daylight
Time is followed by 1:00am Standard Time. If you say you’re born at “1:30am”
local time on that day, it’s unknown whether that means 1:30am Daylight Time,
or 1:30am Standard Time an hour later. Astrolog will display a warning in such
a situation. A similar warning will be displayed if you say you were born
during the one hour gap during which clocks “spring ahead”, which is an invalid
time that never appears on clocks because it gets skipped.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>Display time changes:</span> The new -Nz switch will
display all time changes for the time zone area corresponding to the active
chart’s city, as specified in the “Location” string field. If that string
doesn’t match anything in the atlas, then time changes in all time zones will
be output instead, for a complete output of Astrolog’s worldwide database. This
chart will display every time change to or from Daylight Time, as well as
occasions when the time zone offset itself for the location changes. This will
range from the first date when the location started using a standard time zone
(which will be no earlier than 1847 when GMT was introduced). The list will run
until 2025, or five years after the chart’s date (whichever is later, but never
later than 2080). Time changes will be printed one per line, listing the date
and local time at which the time changes, along with how the time zone offset
changes and how much the local clock time changes. In the Windows version, the
new “Time Changes” button in the Chart Info dialogs will do the same thing.</p>

<p class=B>Time change information is stored in the new file timezone.as, which
gets loaded the first time that such information is needed. This information
was converted from the collaborative open source and public domain TZ database (sometimes
called the “Olson database”) at <a
href="https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html">https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html</a>,
which is used by many programs and operating systems for time zone and Daylight
Saving Time determination. This database is fully accurate everywhere in the
world for 1970 and beyond. Before 1970 time changes are often an inexact science,
but are estimated to be at least 90% accurate. The file timezone.as is an
Astrolog command switch text file like any other, and can be user modified. The
sections within the file describe the format. There are three sections in it,
which contain instances of the following three new command switches:</p>

<p class=B>-YY1 &lt;rules&gt; &lt;entries&gt;: Reads in a new set of Daylight
Saving Time change rules from the current switch file, consisting of the
specified number of rules, each consisting of a sublist of rule entries. First
parameter is number of rules, and second is the total number of rule entry
lines in all rules. The time zone areas in the -YY2 section can specify
different rules to apply at different times.</p>

<p class=B>-YY2 &lt;zones&gt; &lt;entries&gt;: Reads in a new set of time zone
changes from the current switch file, consisting of the specified number of time
zone areas, each consisting of a sublist of zone change entries. First
parameter is number of time zone areas, and second is the total number of zone
change entry lines in all areas. This defines when time zone offsets themselves
change in a particular area, as well as when to apply different Daylight Saving
Time rules.</p>

<p class=B>-YY3 &lt;rows&gt;: Reads in a new set of time zone links from the
current switch file, consisting of the specified number of time zones from
atlas.as, and how each maps to a zone change area as listed in the -YY2 switch
section. This defines how a city’s time zone maps to a time zone area, so the
program can lookup a date/time in question within that area to see the time zone
and Daylight Time offsets that were in effect then.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>3. Show cities:</span> Astrolog’s atlas is graphical! :)
It can plot the location of all cities in its atlas on the graphic world map
and globe displays. To show them, turn on the new -XL switch (which is also
available as the “Show Cities” menu command on the “Graphics / Show Map
Effects” submenu). Normally all cities are displayed in the same color. However,
if the aspect line labeling setting (-XA switch described below) is also on,
then cities will be colored differently. If the -XL switch is invoked with a
trailing digit, it will affect how cities are colored:</p>

<p class=B>-XL1: Cities are colored one of the seven colors of the rainbow
based on their country.<br>
-XL2: Like -XL1 but USA states and Canada provinces are also colored
differently.<br>
-XL3: Cities are colored one of six colors of the rainbow based on their
default time zone offset in effect today. Cities in irregular non-hour time
zones (such as in India) are colored magenta instead.<br>
-XL4: Like -XL3 but the correct offset (including Daylight Time) is calculated
for each city based on the current chart time. For past times before a location
started using time zones, cities are colored gray instead.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>4. Eclipse detection: </span>Astrolog can accurately
detect eclipses and occultations/transits, or when one planet’s disk is
partially covering another. To do this, turn on the new -Yu switch (which is
also available as the “Show Eclipse Information” checkbox in the Display
Settings dialog). When active, appropriate charts will indicate whether
conjunctions and oppositions are eclipses. The aspect list (-a switch), transit
to transit times (-d), and transit to transit influence (-D) charts will
display next to each aspect if it’s an eclipse, and if so whether it’s total
(or an occultation in which one body completely covers another), annular (or a
transit in which one body is passing in front of another), partial (in which
one body partially overlaps another), penumbral (in which part of the Moon is
in the Earth’s shadow, i.e. some part of the Moon’s surface is experiencing a
partial Solar eclipse), or total penumbral (a semi-rare condition in which all
of the Moon is within the Earth’s penumbra, but no part of the Moon is in the full
umbra). Note that for accurate Solar Eclipse times, such as detecting when
totality begins and ends, your location on Earth is very important, so you
should have topocentric positions on (-YV switch). Similarly, for Lunar
Eclipses you want to consider the effect of Earth’s shadow from the geocentric
middle of the planet, which means you should have topocentric positions off.</p>

<p class=B>If the print nearest minute setting (-b0 switch) is in effect, then
any eclipses will include the percentage of the planet’s diameter involved. For
example, for partial eclipses it will range from 1% (just beginning to cover)
to 99% (just shy of totality or annularity). For annular and total eclipses it
will range from 1% (complete overlap just begin) to 100% (planets’ middles
perfectly centered at the same position). For penumbral eclipses it will range
from 1% (Moon just entering Earth’s penumbra) to 100% (totally within
penumbra).</p>

<p class=B>The transit to transit graphs (-B switch) will graph the intensity
of an eclipse over time. In the text mode transit graph, times during eclipses
will be marked by special characters: Total eclipses or occultations are indicated
by “T”, annular eclipses or transits are “A”, partial eclipses are “P”, and
penumbral lunar eclipses are “p”. In graphics mode, a second graph will be
drawn in dark blue overlapping the first. The height of this graph will
indicate the type of eclipse and its percentage progression: Penumbral eclipses
will range from 1/12 to 3/12 height of the area, partial eclipses will range
from 5/12 to 7/12, and annular or total from 9/12 to 11/12. These three “zones”
make it easy to see (for example) a lunar eclipse progressing over time, and
when it moves from penumbral to partial to total.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>5. Aspect line labeling:</span> Lines indicating
aspects between objects (such as seen in the middle of wheel charts, as well as
in solar system orbit charts and chart spheres) have the option to draw the
aspect’s glyph over the middle of the line. The new -XA switch (and the new
“Show Glyphs On Aspect Lines” menu command on the “Graphics / Show Map Effects”
submenu) will label aspect lines in this manner.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>6. Extra asteroids:</span> Astrolog can display custom
asteroids and other bodies, assuming their Swiss Ephemeris format ephemeris
files have been downloaded, however doing so usually requires specifying each
asteroid individually. The new -XE switch will display an arbitrarily long sequence
of asteroids. It takes two parameters: The low and high minor planet numbers of
the bodies to calculate and list. This is a quick way to display hundreds or even
thousands of asteroids at once, assuming their ephemeris files have been
downloaded. Extra asteroids may be seen in the graphics charts for local
horizon (-Z switch), solar system orbit (-S switch), on world maps and chart
spheres, and in the text mode list objects table (-HO switch). For example, here’s
a fun Astrolog animation in which 10,000 asteroids are orbiting around the Sun
at once: <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/asteroid.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/asteroid.gif</a></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>Extra asteroid labeling:</span> The asteroid list
feature is very similar to the existing -XU switch which displays all the stars
in the sefstars.txt file, except this displays a range of asteroids instead.
The -XU switch subsetting will affect asteroids too, in which -XU1 shows just a
dot, -XU2 has the asteroid’s name labeled, -XU3 is a larger dot, and -XU4 is a
large dot with label. Assuming labels are present as defined by -XU, then the -XE
switch can be invoked with a trailing digit to determine how exactly asteroids
are labeled. Doing -XE1 will have no label, -XE2 will label with the asteroid’s
number (e.g. “10”), -XE3 will label with the asteroid’s name (e.g. “Hygiea”),
and -XE4 will label with both number and name (e.g. “10 Hygiea”).</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>Extra asteroid colors:</span> The new -YkE switch can
be used to specify colors to use for particular extra asteroids when the show
asteroids setting (-XE switch) is active. It takes one parameter, which is a
comma separated list of string pairs. These pairs indicate the numeric index of
an asteroid followed by the name of the color to use for it. For example, “-YkE
5,Red,10,Blue” will highlight asteroid “5 Astrea” in red and “10 Hygiea” in blue.
You can also reference the name or number+name of the asteroid, if the -XE
switch is set appropriately so that asteroids are being labeled in that format.
For example, if -XE2 is in effect, then “-YkE Astraea,Red,Hygiea,Blue” will
also work.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>7. Windows context menus:</span> In the Windows
version, each graphics chart has a unique popup menu that can be brought up by
right-clicking on the window. There are 13 different popup menus, which allow
changing settings specialized to that graphics chart. This is a quick and easy
way to modify charts in ways that may not be readily apparent otherwise.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>8. Full screen mode:</span> In the Windows version, the
new “Size Window Full Screen” menu command on the “Edit / Window” submenu
(accessible with the “Shift+Tab” hotkey) will toggle the Astrolog window into
or out of full screen mode. The scrollbars will determine the relative
placement of the Astrolog chart within the screen, if they have different
proportions (e.g. scrollbars centered will center the chart within the screen).
</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>9. Screen saver:</span> Astrolog can act as a Windows
screen saver. To use it as one, copy the Astrolog.exe executable to the file Astrolog.scr
in your Windows system directory (which is usually C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32). The
right directory is the one that has other .scr extension screen savers in it.
Once installed, in Windows select “Start / Settings / Control Panel / Display /
Screen Saver” or equivalent, and pick “Astrolog” from the list. When Previewed
or when started as a screen saver, the default display will be a wheel chart starting
from the current moment now and animating forward a minute at a time. If the
file “astrolog.as” exists in the same directory as Astrolog.scr, then that file
will be loaded on startup, which can change the default behavior. You can’t set
an unlock password when Astrolog is running as a screen saver, and the Settings
button won’t do anything other than show the same animation within a window.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog knows to act as a screen saver when Windows invokes it with
specific command switches, and will exit immediately when a key is pressed or
the mouse is moved. “Astrolog /s” (run screen saver) will run in full screen
mode. “Astrolog /c” and “Astrolog /a” (configure screen saver) will run in
windowed mode. “Astrolog /p” (preview screen saver) will do nothing. One can
invoke Astrolog with these switches to test its screen saver functionality, or
use the new -WZ switch, which will turn on the internal mode which makes the
program exit on the next user action.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>10. Scrollbar positioning:</span> In the Windows
version, the new -WB switch will set the window’s scrollbars. Its two
parameters specify the horizontal and vertical scrollbar positioning. Both are
numbers from 0-24, in which 0 is the left or top edge, 24 is the right or
bottom edge, and 12 is centered in the middle.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>11. Equatorial declination:</span> Astrolog can
display vertical planet coordinates as equatorial declination (instead of as
ecliptic latitude, which is the default). To do this, turn on the new -sr0 switch
(which is also available by turning on “Equatorial Latitudes” in the
Calculation Settings dialog). This is an extension of the old -sr switch, which
turns on equatorial coordinates for both longitude and latitude (but may be
less useful since it distorts zodiac position longitudes). These two settings
together can cover all four combinations of ecliptic versus equatorial
coordinates. For example “=sr _sr0” will result in equatorial longitudes and
ecliptic latitudes, by turning on equatorial for both and then turning off
equatorial latitudes.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>12. Star brightness adjustment:</span> Star brightness
is usually a fixed value indicating the star’s magnitude as currently viewed
from Earth. The new -YUb switch when active adjusts star brightness based on
the star’s current distance from the central object. This is useful when doing
charts for extreme past or future times (in which the stars have drifted to
different distances and therefore brightnesses) and especially when casting
charts centered on other star systems (which have a more immediate effect on
distance and brightness). For example, the star Sirius is magnitude -1.46 now,
however in the year 38,000 when it’s closer to our Sun it will have brightened
to -1.57, and by the year 300,000 it will have dimmed to just +0.01. Also, the
new -YUb0 switch will make brightness be displayed as a star’s absolute
magnitude, or the inherent brightness of the star independent of distance
(which is defined as the magnitude of the star when viewed from 10 parsecs or
32.6 light years away).</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>13. Star velocity ordering:</span> Star objects when
listed in certain charts may be ordered by their longitudinal velocity with the
new -Uv switch. In the Windows version, there’s a new “By Velocity” option in
the “Fixed Star Ordering” section of the Chart Settings dialog.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>14. Restrict all aspects:</span> The new -RA0 switch
will restrict all aspects. (This is similar to the -R0 switch which restricts
all objects, and is equivalent to doing -A 0.) Similarly, the new -RA1 switch
will unrestrict and show all aspects. (This is similar to the -R1 switch which
restricts all objects, and is equivalent to doing -A 18 after -A 0).</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>15. Glyph redefinition:</span> The -YXD and -YXA
switches, which allow one to redefine the graphic glyphs used for objects and
aspects, take two parameters for the small and large sized glyphs, which
requires defining both. The new -YXD1 and -YXA1 switches are simpler in that
they take a single parameter for the small glyph. The large glyph will be the
small glyph scaled appropriately.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>16. Julian calendar date:</span> Astrolog assumes the
Gregorian calendar when inputting and displaying dates after October 15, 1582,
and the Julian calendar for dates before then. In obscure cases, one might want
the Julian calendar in effect later or the Gregorian calendar earlier. The new -ig
switch is like -i, but will read chart data into variables which indicate the
date to use for the start of the Gregorian calendar. The virtual file “__g” can
be used to access the current crossover date. For example, “-qd Mar 1 1700 -ig
nul” will have the Gregorian calendar start on March 1, 1700, as it did in
Germany.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>17. New house systems:</span> Astrolog supports five theoretical
equal house systems. They don’t appear as Windows menu options, but can be
selected by the command line.</p>

<p class=B>-c 22: Midheaven based Whole houses: Standard Whole houses has the
1st house at the start of the sign of the Ascendant. Midheaven based Whole
houses has the 10th house at the start of the sign of the Midheaven. This is
similar to the difference between standard Equal houses which ties the 1st
house to the Ascendant, and Equal (MC) houses which ties the 10th house to the
Midheaven.</p>

<p class=B>-c 23: Midheaven based Vedic houses: Standard Vedic houses has the Ascendant
in the middle of the 1st house. Midheaven based Vedic houses has the MC in the
middle of the 10th house.</p>

<p class=B>-c 24: Balanced Equal houses: This is a mixture between Ascendant
and Midheaven based Equal houses. Here the difference between the Asc and MC is
applied to both the 1st and 10th cusps equally, so the amount the Asc is
different from the 1st cusp is always the same as the amount the MC is
different from the 10th. On a technical level, Balanced Equal houses places the
Asc/MC midpoint in the middle of the 11th house, which ensures a balanced
distribution, as seen in this animation: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/equal.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/equal.gif</a></p>

<p class=B>-c 25 Balanced Whole houses: Similar to Balanced Equal houses, this
is a mixture between Ascendant and Midheaven based Whole houses. Just as
Ascendant based Whole houses has the Ascendant somewhere in the 1st house, and
Midheaven based Whole houses has the Midheaven somewhere in the 10th, Balanced
Whole houses ensures the Asc/MC midpoint is always in the 30 degree section half
way between the 1st and 10th houses.</p>

<p class=B>-c 26: Balanced Vedic houses: Similar to Balanced Equal houses, this
is a mixture between Ascendant and Midheaven based Vedic houses. The end result
of these five theoretical house systems combined with the four more common
existing house systems, is a 3x3 grid of nine house systems total. There’s
Equal, Whole, and Vedic along one axis. Along the other axis, each of these three
concepts can be centered around the Ascendant, centered around the Midheaven,
or balanced between the two.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>18. AstroExpressions:</span> AstroExpressions are programmable
customizations that don’t require recompiling the program, and can be
considered an extended form of command switches. You can compose expressions to
do a variety of operations, such as create your own house systems. There are 13
new AstroExpression related command switches, which all start with “-~” (dash
tilde). See the AstroExpression Features section at the end of this document
for details about them.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=extend>EXTENDED AND IMPROVED FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A list of improvements to existing features in Astrolog 7.00, such
as new things you can now do with old features that you couldn’t do before, or
ways that existing features work better than before:</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>1. 3D house systems:</span> Astrolog now supports
multiple systems of “3D houses”. Every standard house system now has a
corresponding 3D house system, defined by great circles drawn from the due
South point to the due North point on the local horizon, passing through each
2D cusp where it intersects the ecliptic. See <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/placidus.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/placidus.gif</a>
for an example of 3D Placidus houses. Before, Astrolog only supported 3D
Campanus or “3D Equal houses”, in which each 3D house is an equal sized 30
degree slice of the celestial sphere. Note that chart spheres always draw the
horizon (which the Ascendant is on) and meridian (which the Midheaven is on),
which means 3D non-quadrant systems (which disassociate the 1st cusp from the
Ascendant and/or the 10th cusp from the Midheaven) will show 13 or 14 lines
crossing the sphere instead of just 12.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>2. Astro-graph all cusps:</span> Astrolog’s world map
displays can show astrocartography lines on it. These displays will now show
astro-graph lines for the minor cusps as well, when the minor cusp objects are
unrestricted. Just as the Ascendant line in astrocartography shows where on the
world an object is rising, a minor cusp line shows where on the world the
object is exactly conjunct that cusp (or its 3D cusp to be precise). Standard
astro-graph lines are based on the angles, and that means non-quadrant house
systems (which disassociate the 1st cusp from the Ascendant and/or the 10th
cusp from the Midheaven) will show 13 or 14 lines on the world instead of just
12. Note that this addition is only for the world map and globe displays which
can show astro-graph lines, while the actual astro-graph chart (-L switch) is
still limited to the classic view of the angles.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>3. Screen fonts:</span> The Windows version of
Astrolog can now display real fonts in graphics charts on screen, for sign,
planet, and aspect glyphs. Before, one could only include actual fonts in
PostScript and Windows metafile files, and Astrolog’s internal vector font was
the only option for screen graphics. Now, the “Use Real System Fonts In
Graphics Charts” option in the Display Settings dialog (-YXf switch) will
affect screen graphics too.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>4. Aspect calendar:</span> Astrolog’s graphic calendar
chart (-K -X switches) will include aspect and other events times within each day’s
box, if the new “show glyphs on aspect lines” setting is active (-XA switch).
This effectively combines the graphic calendar with the existing transit to
transit times search (-d switch). Depending on the amount of room available in
the boxes, displayed will be the aspect event, its exact time, and markers for
void of course Moon and Moon phases. Do you miss the aspect calendars in Jim
Maynard’s Celestial Guide and Pocket Astrologer books, after they stopped
printing them? This feature can allow you to make your own. :)</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>5. Multi-year graphic ephemeris:</span> The graphic
ephemeris (-E -X switches) can now graph multiple years instead of just one
year. The parameter passed to the -EY multiple ephemeris years switch (which is
also present in the “Years To Span” field in the Transits dialog in the Windows
version) will determine how many years the graphic ephemeris covers.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>6. Applying parallel aspects:</span> Applying/separating
indicators will now be shown for parallel and contraparallel aspects. Before,
all such “vertical” aspects would always be shown as separating. Also, when the
applying aspects setting is not active, the +/- sign for the orb will show
whether the average of the two planets’ positions is above or below 0
declination.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>7. Vertical velocity:</span> The velocity of a
planet’s motion along the vertical latitude axis (which is used to compute
applying/separating parallel aspects) will be displayed in the standard text
mode chart (-v switch) when the print nearest second setting (-b0 switch) is
on. This will be shown in the last column if the parallel aspects setting is
off (otherwise the decan position will be shown there, which was the only
option available in previous versions).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>8. Dispositor objects extended:</span> The graphic
dispositor chart (-j -X switches) will include all non-star and non-cusp
objects in the graphs, when unrestricted. For example, you can include
asteroids, Nodes, Lilith, and Uranians in these charts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>9. New dispositor settings:</span> The graphic
dispositor chart is affected by the Vedic wheel display setting (-J switch),
which will cause the dispositor wheel to arrange objects clockwise instead of
counterclockwise around it. Also, the dispositor chart is affected by the show
house details setting, which will cause the depositor wheel to have the Sun or
first object at the top of the wheel instead of at the left.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>10. Transit influence summary:</span> The transit
influence charts (-D and -T switches) will print an aspect summary afterward,
listing the total and average power of the aspects, along with the count of
each aspect and the count of aspects to each planet. This is similar to the
summary displayed after the aspect list chart (-a switch), and like that
summary it’s on by default can be removed by turning off the -a0 switch
setting.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>11. One day transits:</span> The transit to natal
times search (-t switch) and progressed to progressed times search (-dp switch)
can now be done for a single day. The default is to search over a month, since
these are slower events that often only have a few per month. Before, the
minimum amount they would search would be a month, even when “Given Day” was
selected in the Transits dialog. On the command line, the new -td &lt;day&gt;
&lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; switch will search over a single day.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>12. Aspects to Arabic parts:</span> The Arabic parts
list chart now has an option to, for each part, display a list of aspects from
unrestricted planets to it. This is similar to how the midpoint list chart can
display aspects to midpoints, and as a result the “text midpoint list includes
aspects to midpoints” chart setting (-ma switch) will affect the Arabic parts
chart too.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>13. Mystic rectangle configuration:</span> Aspect
configurations as displayed in the text mode aspect grid chart (-g0 switch)
will now include instances of the Mystic Rectangle aspect configuration (a
rectangle composed of two Trines and two Sextiles).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>14. Aspect list events:</span> The aspect list chart
will flag notable aspects such as Moon phases (e.g. “Full Moon”) and eclipses
(if the new -Yu switch setting is on).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>15. Orbit chart extension:</span> The text mode solar
system orbit chart (-S switch) will now display the azimuth in the current
display format (zodiac position, number, or hours/minutes) instead of only as a
number. Also, when star objects are unrestricted, their brightness will be
included.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>16. Text chart info extension:</span> When doing text
mode charts, the program will display chart information (such as date and time)
above most of them. Before, only the standard listing would have a header,
which would often leave other chart types lacking context. When displaying
multiple different text charts at once, only the first chart will contain a
header.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>17. Graphic chart info extension:</span> In graphics
charts, when displaying chart info at the bottom of the chart, this line of
text will now include the chart’s name and location strings.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>18. Time zone details:</span> In the Windows version,
the “Time Zone” field in the Chart Info dialogs lists the hour offset for each
time zone in addition to its abbreviation, in the field’s dropdown. Before
you’d have to select and apply an abbreviation, then display a chart or go back
into the dialog to see what offset an abbreviation actually referred to. Although
improved, specifying time zones is less important now, given Astrolog’s new
ability to automatically detect a city’s time zone and Daylight offset for a
time and location.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>19. Ayanamsa details:</span> In the Windows version,
the “Zodiac Offset / Ayanamsa” field in the Calculation Settings dialog lists
the name of common ayanamsas in addition to their offset, in the field’s
dropdown. That of course makes it much easier to select a common ayanamsa
without having to know which offset corresponds to it.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>20. Time parsing extended:</span> When parsing time
zones, the number can now be preceded by the letter “H”, e.g. “h5w” is the same
as “5w”. Also, for times and locations, seconds can be specified by having four
digits in a row after the degree/hour, e.g. “12:3456” is equivalent to
“12:34:56”. These are formats used by Astrodienst on astro.com, which it’s good
to be able to parse.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>21. Orbit trails extended:</span> The -YXj switch
which specifies the length of orbit trails in the graphics mode solar system
orbit chart (-S -X switches) has been extended. If the -YXj switch parameter is
negative, it will instead draw complete orbits for objects circling the Sun or
Earth. These orbits will be circles of the object’s current radius in the plane
of the ecliptic, so aren’t fully accurate, but are still visually useful. Orbit
circles will only be drawn for objects whose transit restrictions are also
unrestricted, which allows specifying which objects you want to see orbits for.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>22. Customize star glyphs:</span> The -YXD switch to
customize the graphic glyphs for objects now supports customizing star glyphs
too. Before, star objects could only be marked with text abbreviations.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>23. Constellation lines improved:</span> The -YXU
switch which allows defining lines between points in the list of all stars has
been improved. The second parameter usually has number indexes separated with
commas, however a semicolon will treat subsequent numbers as starting one
beyond the highest number seen so far. That allows defining separate
constellations without having to keep track of continually increasing index
numbers.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>24. Virtual colors:</span> Colors can be specified as
references to other colors, in Windows dropdowns and in command switches taking
color values. For example, &quot;Fire&quot; (the current color of the element
Fire), &quot;Jupiter&quot; (Jupiter’s current color), &quot;Conjunction&quot; (the
aspect’s current color), and &quot;Ray3&quot; (that Ray’s current color) all
work. Color references can be abbreviated by the first three characters, or
however much is needed to be unique. Note that these are one time only input translations
to the current value of a particular color, and aren’t persistent aliases that
will update if the referenced color is later changed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>25. Windows menu improvement:</span> The Windows
version will now place a radio button check mark by the active chart type being
displayed. For example, checking “Aspect List” on the Charts menu, “Chart
Sphere” on Graphics menu, or “List Switches” on Help menu will place a mark by those
commands indicating they’re in effect.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=change>PROGRAM CHANGES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A few changes that aren't new feature additions or bug fixes have
been made to Astrolog 7.00, which means certain old assumptions are no longer
valid. Most can be considered improvements, but they still change existing
behavior. A list of these follows (which aren't useful to be aware of unless
you have used previous versions of the program):</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>1. Animate transit times:</span> In the Windows
version, animating charts forward or backward will adjust the time of the
transiting chart or the progressed chart. This is more expected and useful than
animating the natal chart, as was done before. This will happen when animating
the “Transit And Natal” or “Progressed And Natal” bi-wheels (-rt and -rp
switches).</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>2. Equatorial Positions split:</span> In the Windows
version, the “Equatorial Positions” checkbox in the Calculation Settings dialog
has been split into the two new checkboxes “Equatorial Latitudes” and “Equatorial
Longitudes”. Before, one had to change both together. Now, you can show
equatorial declinations in charts without changing zodiac positions, which is a
common preference.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>3. Prompt ordering:</span> In command line versions of
the program, when the program interactively prompts one to enter chart
information for each field, this process will now prompt for location before
(instead of after) the Daylight Time, time zone, and location fields. If the
location field matches a city in the atlas, then the appropriate values for
Daylight Time, time zone, and location will be displayed. The user still has to
type in those values, but they can now just follow the recommendations.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>4. File headers changed:</span> The identifying line
at the start of Astrolog command switch files has been changed slightly. All
Astrolog command switch files start with a line beginning with “@A”, followed
by a character identifying the file subtype (which is one of “IPDCZ”), followed
by the program version number not counting the period (i.e. “700”).
Specifically, Astrolog chart info files start with “@AI700”, chart position
files chart with “@AP700”, and default settings files like “astrolog.as” start
with “@AD700”. The new city atlas file starts with “@AC700”, and the new
timezone change file starts with “@AZ700”. This new scheme is more easily
understood than before, in which all files started with “@” and then four digits,
in which the first two digits were the file type (e.g. “01” for chart info
files), and the second two digits were the file version which would increment
each time the file changed in a reasonably significant way. Astrolog 7.00 and
earlier versions can still load each others’ files without problem.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>5. Commands renamed:</span> Some Windows menu commands
have been renamed. “Chart / Standard List” is now “Chart / Standard Radix” (because
the chart is only a list in text mode, but is the standard wheel chart in graphics
mode). Also, on the Graphics menu the “Show Chart Sphere”, “Show World Map”,
“Show Globe”, and “Show Polar Globe” commands now start with “Draw” instead of
“Show”. That distinguishes actual charts from mere settings that affect charts
such as the “Show Border” command.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>6. X icon changed:</span> In X Windows versions, the program’s
icon is now the same ringed planet as seen in the Windows version. It’s no
longer a rainbow over an eye.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Section><a name=bug>BUG FIXES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are bugs or other issues with version 6.50, all of which have
been corrected in 7.00:</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>1. Progressed event times inaccurate:</span> Transit
to transit event times for progressions (-dp switch) would display the time
within the day wrong (most often being much earlier in the day than it should
be).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>2. Progression label wrong:</span> The -p progression
switch wouldn’t remember the progression date. That normally wasn’t a problem,
since the progressed chart would still be cast correctly. However, the wheel
chart sidebar which shows the date progressed to would incorrectly show a default
date. This only affected the -p command switch, and not the Windows “Progressions”
dialog.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>3. Heliocentric Nodes wrong:</span> The Moon’s nodes
and Lilith would always have their geocentric zodiac positions displayed, even
when heliocentric mode is active. They’d also display wrong positions when
bodies other than the Earth or Sun were the central planet.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>4. Latitude crossing bug:</span> The list of latitude
crossings in the text mode astro-graph chart (-L0 switch) would display bogus
crossings for the Earth (if the Earth object was unrestricted) and when objects
after object index 50 were present (which means most fixed stars).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>5. Void of course omission:</span> The Moon void of
course markers in the transit to transit times chart (-d switch) would fail to
notice an aspect event as the Moon going v/c, when the last Moon aspect is in a
different month than the Moon entering the next sign. This also happened if the
Moon aspect event and Moon changing sign event were in different blocks of 50
events (e.g. on lines 50 and 51 of the output).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>6. Transiting objects limitation:</span> Transiting
cusps (when enabled with the -RT and -YRT command switches) wouldn’t appear in
charts such as transit to natal bi-wheels, unless at least one standard
non-transiting cusp object (such as the Ascendant) was unrestricted too. A
similar issue would affect Uranian and fixed star objects, which also required
at least one standard object in their category to be unrestricted before they’d
show up in transits.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>7. Negative coordinate parsing:</span> Specifying a
time or longitude/latitude offset as a negative numeric value such as “-1:12” would
negate the hour but not the minutes, which maps to 12 minutes after hour -1,
which would be 0:48e, which probably isn’t what one wanted. Now “-1:12” will be
the same as “1:12e” (just like “1:12” is the same as “1:12w”).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>8. HST and NZT zone offset:</span> The time zone
abbreviations Hawaii Time (HT) and New Zealand Time (NZT) were treated as half
hour offsets, when (at least in modern times) they’re full hour offsets.
Although updated, specifying time zones is less important now, given Astrolog’s
new ability to automatically detect a city’s time zone and Daylight offset for
a time and location.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>9. LMT zone display:</span> Specifying the time zone
of Local Mean Time would work, however it would be displayed as offset “24.0”
in charts and in the Chart Info time zone dropdown, instead of as “LMT”.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>10. Astro-graph animation:</span> When showing the
graphic globe or world map with astro-graph lines on it, animation would always
rotate the world and never animate the time of the chart being displayed. In
other words, this case would ignore the “animate map instead of time setting”
(-XN switch).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>11. Graphic calendar display:</span> The graphic
calendar (-K -X switches) would sometimes display the name of the month in too
large a size, such that it goes over the left and right edges of the window.
Display of the month name (and the numbers within each day box) now won’t ever
be larger than will fit within their area.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>12. Transit graph display:</span> The graphic transit
charts (-B/-V -X switches) would sometimes have the text in the upper left
corner that indicates the transit date overlap the top row, if the text was too
large to fit. Now this text will only be displayed if it fits within the
available space.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>13. Influence ranking bug:</span> The text influence
chart (-j switch) would incorrectly skip a rank if a sign’s power was zero. For
example, if all planets were restricted, signs would be ranked 2-13, instead of
1-12. Similarly, the text esoteric chart (-7 switch) would display garbage
percentage values in the corner case of all planets being restricted.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>14. Equatorial positions bug:</span> The equatorial
positions setting (-sr switch) wouldn’t work right if the parallel aspects
setting (-gp switch) was on at the same time. The effect of both would be to do
the ecliptic to equatorial coordinate shift twice, which would distort the
parallel aspects present. The parallel aspects setting is now smart enough to
only coordinate shift once if vertical coordinates are already being displayed as
equatorial latitudes.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>15. Midpoint aspect display:</span> Aspects to
midpoints in the midpoint list chart (-ma switch) would incorrectly show
Par/Cpr aspect abbreviations in place of Con/Opp, when parallel aspects (-gp
switch) was active, even though the aspects present are actually Conjunction
and Opposition.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>16. Astro-graph Mollewide glitch:</span> Astro-graph
lines on the Mollewide projection of the world map would sometimes stretch to
the edge of the window, instead of just to the edge of the world’s oval
boundary.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>17. Sidebar omissions:</span> The sidebar of the
graphics wheel chart should include house cusp objects in the list (even if
it’s the same as the corresponding house cusp already listed) if its latitude
is non-zero. Usually house cusp objects are at latitude 0, but having
equatorial latitudes on (-sr switch) can move them. Also, the sidebar now
includes a line for the harmonic chart factor (-x switch) if it’s been set.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>18. Custom objects bug:</span> The -Ye switches wouldn’t
accept multiple suffixes before, which meant for example that -YeHS to toggle both
the heliocentric and sidereal zodiac settings of an object wouldn’t work.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>19. Extra stars limitation:</span> The display of list
extra stars (-XU switch) wouldn’t properly make another star object the central
object, if the Sun was restricted.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>20. Add time bug:</span> The -- and -+ switches, which
add a number of days to the current chart time, would sometimes apply their
offset more than once. They’d keep applying that same offset every time the
screen updated.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>21. Animation glitch:</span> Animating a chart by
minutes or seconds over a period of time would occasionally result in roundoff
error when entering a new hour or day. For example, it could show the time as 12:00am
on one day, when the planet positions are really showing 12:00am the next day.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>22. Metafile font issue:</span> Creating Windows
metafiles (-XM switch) with system fonts would embed the font “Astro-Semibold”
(and therefore require it to be installed to display correctly). That’s an
inferior version of, and is also inconsistent with, the “Astro” font used
elsewhere in the program.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>23. Wireframe globe display:</span> The 3D wireframe
globe had a few display issues. It reversed the consideration of the modify
display setting (-Xi switch) from the standard 2D globe, when deciding whether
to show 3D astro-graph lines. It would accidentally include the chart
information from the bottom of the screen of 2D charts within the 3D wireframe.
It also wouldn’t draw a ring around the globe at the latitude of the chart (-L0
switch) like the 2D chart does.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>24. Wireframe constellation glitch:</span> The
wireframe constellation globe would produce a small extra horizontal line
crossing the sphere near the bottom at the edge of the constellation Octans, at
certain rotation values of the sphere.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>25. X Windows display:</span> On some X Windows
systems, lines on the screen would end one pixel short, resulting in (for
example) slightly truncated text characters and glyphs. Also, certain lines
wouldn’t appear at all, such as the transit graph chart would appear mostly blank.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>26. X Windows omission:</span> The timed exposure
feature (-Xj switch) wouldn’t work on X Windows systems.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>27. Windows scrollbar omission:</span> Scrollbars in
the Windows version wouldn’t scroll when selecting the dial and dragging it to
another location. Also, right clicking on a scrollbar and selecting “Scroll
Here”, “Left Edge”, “Right Edge”, “Top”, or “Bottom” wouldn’t do anything.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>28. Windows menu omission:</span> Compiling out
options in the Windows version wouldn’t remove the associated menu commands.
Running a more limited Windows version will now have fewer menu options,
instead of dead menu options still present that do nothing.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=express>ASTROEXPRESSION FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>AstroExpressions are a versatile new feature area introduced in
Astrolog 7.00. The term “AstroExpression” stands for “Astrolog Expression”.
AstroExpressions are programmable customizations that don’t require recompiling
the program, and can be considered an extended form of command switches. You
can compose expressions to do a variety of simple or advanced operations, such
as create your own house systems. AstroExpressions are composed of the
following components, which are defined as follows:</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Constant:</span> A fixed numeric value. For example,
“True” (which always evaluates to 1), and “Signs” (the number of signs in the
zodiac, which is 12). Indexes into the alphabet can be indicated by “%a”
(number 1) through “%z” (26). Also, there are lists of constants available for
months, objects, aspects, house systems, signs of the zodiac, color indexes,
and days of the week. These constants start with a letter and an underscore,
followed by at least three letters (or enough to be unique). For example,
“M_January”, “O_Jupiter”, “A_Trine”, “H_Placidus”, “S_Leo”, “K_Green”, and
“W_Sunday”.</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Variable:</span> A numeric value stored somewhere,
which can change. For example, “Mon” is the month of the current chart.</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Custom Variable:</span> One of a set of generic
variables, which don’t correspond to any specific program setting, but can be
used by expressions to store whatever they want. An example is an index while
looping over the list of all objects. Some numeric variables are automatically
set by the program before it evaluates an AstroExpression hook, and can be
considered special parameters to that expression. Also, some custom variables
are automatically queried by the program after an expression hook returns, and
can be considered as special return values from that hook. The custom variable
slots start at index #0 and end at index #26. Custom numeric variables #0
through #9 can be referenced with the @ prefix (e.g. @0 or @9). Custom
variables #1 through #26 can also be referenced with @a through @z. Note the
important distinction between “%a” (which is always 1) and “@a” (which is the
value contained within variable #1).</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Parameter:</span> A piece of data passed to a function
or variable assignment. Parameters are either constants, variables, or
functions. Anything that’s not a constant is a variable or function to be
queried or evaluated.</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Type:</span> The type of data contained in a parameter
or variable. All parameters and variables contain either integers or real
numbers. Integers are signed 32 bit numbers. Real numbers are floating point
numbers, and real constants always contain decimal points (e.g. “1.0” is real
number 1, while “1” is integer 1). Boolean values are no different from
integers, in which False is represented by 0, and True is represented by 1 or
any non-zero number.</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Function:</span> A type of parameter, which evaluates
to a number. Functions are followed by zero or more nested parameters. An
example is “Add”, which takes two numeric parameters and returns their sum. A
function that takes zero parameters and always evaluates to the same thing is a
named constant, such as “False” or a specific color like “K_Red”. Functions
always precede their parameters, which means AstroExpressions are in prefix
format, e.g. “Mul Add 1 2 Sub 4 3” expresses “Multiply(Add(1, 2), Subtract(4,
3))” or “(1 + 2) x (4 - 3)”.</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Expression:</span> A string of text which gets
evaluated, and returns a result. If an expression consists of multiple subexpressions,
they will be evaluated in sequence, and the value of the last one will be
returned. All parameters can be considered subexpressions contained within a
larger expression.</p>

<p class=B><span class=X>Hook:</span> A type of expression that can be defined
which is “hooked” into a particular part of the program, which (if defined)
gets evaluated every time that part of the program runs. There are hooks into
object and house cusp calculation which can modify their positions, along with
hooks into certain charts which allow filtering or modifying their outputs.</p>

<p class=A>The following lists all AstroExpression functions. The name of each
function is listed, followed by the type of its return value and the expected
types of its parameters (if any). Numbers will automatically be converted to
Integer or Real as needed. “Num” means either type is handled, without any
conversion needed. If “Num” is the return value, then if any “Num” parameters
are Real the return type will be real, else integer. For example, “Add 1 2.5”
will cast integer 1 to real 1.0, then add two real numbers to return 3.5.
“Bool” means the function returns an integer (0 for False or 1 for True).</p>

value is number of arc-seconds.</p>

<p class=A>Programming functions (which are related to programming and control
flow):</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Var:</span> Num(Int): Variable lookup. Returns the
value within the referenced custom variable.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Do:</span> Num(Num1, Num2): Evaluate the parameter
Num1, then return Num2. “Do” is useful as the function inside control flow
functions such as “If” and “For”, to chain multiple operations together.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Do2:</span> Num(Num1, Num2, Num3): Evaluate the
parameters Num1 and Num2, then return Num3.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Do3:</span> Num(Num1, Num2, Num3, Num4): Evaluate the
parameters Num1 through Num3, then return Num4.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>If:</span> Num(Int, Num): If statement. If Int is
true, then evaluate Num. Returns Num if true, else 0. Note that Num will only
be evaluated if Int is true. Like the “if” statement in C.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>IfElse:</span> Num(Int, Num1, Num2): If/else. If Int
is true, then evaluate and return Num1, otherwise evaluate and return Num2.
Note that unlike the similar “?:” function, here only one of Num1 and Num2 will
be evaluated. Like the “if / else” statement in C.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DoCount:</span> Num(Int, Num): Loop. Evaluate
expression Num for Int number of times in sequence. Return the final evaluation
of Num (or 0 if it never got evaluated).</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>While:</span> Num(Int, Num): While loop. Evaluates Int
as an expression. If true, evaluates Num and then repeats. Keep reevaluating
until expression Int is no longer true. Return the final evaluation of Num (or
0 if it never got evaluated). Warning: Expressions like “While True 0” will run
forever and hang the program! Like the “while” statement in C.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DoWhile:</span> Num(Int, Num): Do/while loop.
Evaluates Num as an expression, then evaluates Int as an expression. If true,
then evaluate again, and repeat until expression Int is no longer true. Return
the final evaluation of Num. Like the “do/while” statement in C.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>For:</span> Int(Int1, Int2, Int3, Num): For loop. Set custom
variable indicated by Int1 to Int2. While Int1 is less than or equal to Int3, evaluate
Num, then increment Int1. Returns the final value of Int1 after the loop
finishes. In most cases one wants to specify the variable Int1 as “%a” instead
of “@a”. The former makes variable %a itself loop, while the latter makes the
custom variable pointed to by the value of @a loop. Similar to the “for” loop
in various languages.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Macro: </span>Num(Int). Macro expression. Run and
return the result of custom expression that was defined in slot Int with the ~M
command switch.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Assign:</span> Num(Int, Num): Variable assignment.
Assigns Num to the custom variable Int, and also returns that number. Can also
use “=” as a shortcut for “Assign”. </p>

<p class=B><span class=W>=a:</span> Num(Num): Assign to “A”. Assigns Num to
custom variable “A”, and also returns that number. Can also use functions “=b”
through “=z” to assign to them.</p>

<p class=A>There are several new command switches which allow one to define
AstroExpression “hooks” into areas of chart calculation or display, to modify
or filter their results. All AstroExpression related command switches start
with the tilde (~) character:</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>1. ~ &lt;string&gt;:</span> Parse AstroExpression. The
passed in string will be parsed and evaluated, and the return value displayed.
This is useful for debugging expressions, or querying the value of custom
variables. For example, “<span class=Y>~ 'Sqr Div 9.0 4.0'</span>” will
evaluate and display the expression “SquareRoot(9.0 / 4.0)” which is 1.5.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>2. ~a &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust aspect powers.
Called during the -a switch aspect list chart, and allows one to adjust each
aspect’s power. On entry, custom variables @w and @y are the two objects
forming aspect, @x is the aspect, and @z is the current power (in thousandths,
e.g. a power of 1.234 is integer 1234). Return value is ignored, although if @z
is changed it will be the new power to use. For example, to triple the power of
any aspect involving an object in the sign Sagittarius, do: <span class=Y>~a
&quot;If Or Equ LonSign ObjLon @w S_Sag Equ LonSign ObjLon @y S_Sag =z Mul @z
3&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>3. ~E &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter ephemeris output.
Called for each line in the text ephemeris chart. Return value is whether to
display the line. For example, to do a stellium search and only display
ephemeris lines in which there are at least 5 planets in the same sign, do: <span
class=Y>astrolog -n -Ey ~E &quot;For %m 1 Signs = @m 0 For %m 0 Objs If ObjOn
@m = LonSign ObjLon @m Inc Var LonSign ObjLon @m =n 0 For %m 1 Signs =n Max @n
Var @m Gte @n 5&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>4. ~d &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter transit to transit
events. Called for each event in the -d switch chart. On entry, @q is the first
object forming the event, @r is the object’s zodiac position, @s is the
object’s retrogradation (negative for retrograde), @t is the aspect or other
event (-1: sign change, -2: direction change, -3: degree change), @u is the
second object forming the event (or new sign if that event), @v is the second
object’s zodiac position, @w is the second object’s retrogradation, @x is Moon
void of course indicator for how many seconds it will be v/c (-1 for not going
v/c in this event), @y is the eclipse type (-1: eclipse detection turned off,
0: no eclipse, 1: penumbral, 2: total penumbral, 3: partial, 4: annular, 5:
total), and @z is the eclipse percentage (if any). Return value is whether to
display the event. For example, to display eclipses for this year (at least
those in effect when corresponding aspect is exact) do: <span class=Y>astrolog
-n -dy =Yu ~d &quot;Gt @y 0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>5. ~t &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter transit to natal
events. Called for each event in the -t switch chart. On entry, @t is the first
object forming the event, @u is the object’s zodiac position, @v is the
object’s retrogradation (negative for retrograde), @w is the aspect (or -4 for
3D house change), @x is the second object forming the event (or destination
house if 3D house change), @y is the second object’s zodiac position, and @z is
the second object’s retrogradation. Return value is whether to display the
transit. For example, to only display transit events taking place on weekends,
do: <span class=Y>~t &quot;=a DayWeek Mon Day Yea Or Equ @a 0 Equ @a 6&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>6. ~j &lt;string&gt;: </span>Filter influence powers.
Called when a chart’s object and aspect powers are computed in the text mode -j
influence and -7 esoteric charts. On entry, @x is the object, @y is its power
due to positioning, and @z is its power due to aspects. Return value is
ignored, although if you update @y and @z they will be the new powers used. For
example, to give an extra 100 power to completely unaspected planets, do: <span
class=Y>~j &quot;=n 0 For %i 0 Objs If And Neq @i @x GridNam Min @i @x Max @i
@x =n Inc @n If Lte @n 0 =z Add @z 100.0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>7. ~O &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust object position.
Called each time a chart is cast, and allows changing objects’ positions. On
entry, @v is the object index, @w is the object’s zodiac position, @x is the
object’s ecliptic latitude, @y is the object’s zodiac position velocity
(negative for retrograde), and @z is the object’s vertical velocity. Return
value is ignored, although if you update @w through @z the object’s positions
and velocities will be updated. For example, to invert all zodiac positions 180
degrees for locations south of the equator, do: <span class=Y>~O &quot;=w Add
@w 180.0 Lt Lat 0.0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>8. ~C &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust house cusp
position. Called each time a chart is cast, and allows changing house cusp
positions. On entry, @x is the house cusp (1-12), @y is the cusp’s zodiac
position, and @z is the cusp’s 3D house position. Return value is ignored,
although if @y and @z are changed the cusp’s positions will be updated. For
example, Astrolog supports Null houses or the “0 Aries” system, an equal house
system in which the 1st house cusp is always 0Aries. Suppose you want a “0 Leo”
house system in which the 1st house cusp is always 0Leo? This can be done with:
<span class=Y>~C &quot;=y Mul Sub Add S_Leo @x 2 30.0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>9. ~A &lt;string&gt;:</span> Redefine aspect orb.
Called for each cell whenever the aspect grid is internally composed. On entry,
@v and @x are the two objects potentially being aspected, @w is the aspect, @y
is the difference in angle between them (negative for applying and positive for
separating), and @z is the default max orb. Return value is ignored, although
if @z is changed it will be the new max orb to use. For example, to have
separating aspects have 70% the orb of applying aspects, do: <span class=Y>~A
&quot;If Gt @y 0.0 =z Mul @z 0.70&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>10. ~kO &lt;string&gt;:</span> Customize object color.
Called each time an object glyph is displayed, and allows one to change its
color. On entry, @y is the object, and @z is the default color. Return value is
ignored, although if @z is changed it will be the new color to use. For
example, to make planets colored the same as the zodiac sign they’re located
within, do: <span class=Y>~kO &quot;=z ObjCol Dec Add O_Asc LonSign ObjLon
@y&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>11. ~kA &lt;string&gt;:</span> Customize aspect color.
Called each time an aspect line is drawn between two planets in a wheel chart,
and allows one to change its color. On entry, @w and @y are the two objects
being aspected, @x is the aspect, and @z is the default color. Return value is
ignored, although if @z is changed it will be the new color to use. For
example, to change the color of aspect lines involving the Sun or Moon to
magenta, do: <span class=Y>~kA &quot;If Or Lte @w O_Moo Lte @y O_Moo =z K_Mag&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>12. ~M &lt;0-26&gt; &lt;string&gt;:</span> Define
AstroExpression macro: Similar to command switch macros, you can define custom
AstroExpression macro functions. The first parameter is the macro slot to fill,
and the second is the AstroExpression to place within it. Macros can be called
in AstroExpressions with the “Macro &lt;arg&gt;” function, in which parameter
&lt;arg&gt; is the macro index to call.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>13. ~0:</span> Disable AstroExpressions.
AstroExpressions are often hooks inserted into program operation, which means
they may be evaluated on every screen update. Therefore, they automatically get
disabled if there’s an error parsing one, to avoid a continuous stream of
errors. The ~0 switch disables all AstroExpression hooks in the current program
session, which means “_~0” can be used to reenable them. This setting will also
disable the display of the result when using the ~ switch, although not any
side effects of its evaluation (which is useful to e.g. initialize custom
variables in switch files without getting popup windows). In the Windows
version, the “Enter Command Line” dialog has a new “Enable AstroExpression
Hooks” checkbox, which can be used to enable, disable, or check their status.</p>

<p class=N>One final feature is that parsing of many dialog fields and command
switches can use AstroExpressions. If the parameter starts with a tilde (~)
character, then the rest of it will be parsed as an AstroExpression. For
example, to find and restrict the first unrestricted object, do: <span class=Y>-R
&quot;~=b 0 For %a 0 Objs If ObjOn @a Do =b @a =a Objs @b&quot;</span></p>
