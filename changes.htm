<p class=FA>                         **  VERSION 7.30  **</p>

<p class=FA>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=A>Release notes for Astrolog version 7.30 (September 2021):</p>

<p class=A>Happy 30th birthday Astrolog! :) The very first version of Astrolog
was released in September 1991, 30 years ago. This file describes the freeware
astrology software program Astrolog version 7.30 and the additions and fixes
made to it, over the previous version 7.20 which was released five months ago in
April 2021. The main things in this update are improved wheel charts, a new
planet visibility chart, additional font support, and multiple 3D house models.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=feature>NEW FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are new additions to version 7.30 that weren't in previous
versions:</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>1. Filled wheels:</span> Astrolog’s wheel charts can
now be filled in with color, which generally looks better and has more
contrast. This affects the outer sign and house wedge areas in wheel charts,
and sectors in the Gauquelin sector chart. The default fill used for wheels is
a darker version of the color of the object (e.g. the color of the sign) which
is darkened by the background transparency percentage value (-XI switch). If
this percentage is set to over 50%, then the glyphs will be drawn in black or
white instead, to be more visible on the more brightly colored background.
Wheels can also be filled in with colors around the rainbow, starting with
Aries or the 1st house being red. The new -Xv switch sets which type of wheel
fill to use, in which 0 is turned off (if you want the old behavior of outlines
only), 1 is standard fill, and 2 is rainbow fill. In the Windows version, the
new “Wheel Fill” field in the Graphics Settings dialog allows one to select
among these three options. Note that filled wheels are only impended in bitmap
files, in Windows metafile files, and on the Windows screen. They won’t appear
in PostScript files, on X11 windows, or when printing from Windows.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>2. Quin and Hexa wheels:</span> Astrolog now supports
quin-wheels and hexa-wheels, or wheel charts with 5 and 6 different rings of
planets. On the command line, the -r5 and -r6 switches display this many
charts, and the -i5 and -i6 switches will load chart information into chart
slots #5 and #6. In the Windows version, the “Info / Charts #3 through #6” menu
command allows one to enter data into or open files into these charts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>3. Windows text fonts:</span> In the Windows version, system
fonts can be used for text displayed on screen. The new “Text” dropdown in the
Graphics Settings dialog allows one to select which font to use for text.
Options are “Astrolog” for Astrolog’s internal vector drawing (old behavior),
as well as the fixed width fonts “Courier New” and “Consolas”. I find Consolas
looks the best, although that font may not be available on older versions of
Windows. The -YXf switch has been extended to take 5 digits instead of just 4,
in which the 10000’s place digit indicates which font to use for text
(0=Astrolog, 6=Courier, 7=Consolas).</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>4. Planet visibility chart:</span> Astrolog has a new
planet visibility chart which maps planet visibility for a year, showing when
it’s above the horizon. In this chart, the horizontal axis is time of day, and
the vertical axis is day within the year. Pixels are plotted if the planet is
above the horizon at the date/time, allowing one to see at a glance when a
planet is visible, and how those times change during the year. Up to three
planets (the first three unrestricted objects) will be included, in which the
first object is red, the second green, and the third blue. Points where
multiple planets are visible are given the combination of those colors, e.g.
times when the red and blue planets are both above the horizon will be magenta.
A key showing which planets or planet combinations are which colors is placed
below the graph. For example, if you want to check times for when both Mars and
Jupiter are visible at night, restrict everything but Sun (red), Mars (green),
and Jupiter (blue), and check the date/time areas that are cyan (in which red
is off, and green and blue are on). This chart is the graphics version of
Astrolog’s rising and setting times chart, so can be selected with the -Zd -X switches,
or the “Rising and Setting” command in the Windows version.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>5. Savard-A houses:</span> Astrolog now supports the Savard-A
system of house division. This system is named after John Savard, and uses his
description of what he calls Albategnus houses. However, research into
Albategnius' writings shows that he never mentioned this particular house
system, which is why it's called “Savard-A” instead of “Albategnius”. In the
Windows version this system can be selected with a new command on the “House
System” submenu. On the command line, Savard-A houses can be accessed with “-c
21”. Astrolog now supports 23 house systems total (along with 11 additional
experimental systems, and 3D house variations of all of them).</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>6. 3D house models:</span> Astrolog now supports three
different models of 3D houses, in which a planet’s vertical latitude as well as
zodiac position longitude affects which house a planet lies within. To select
the model, pass an optional numeric argument to the -c3 switch, or in the
Windows version select the desired “3D Houses Plane” in the Calculation
Settings dialog. The 3D boundaries of the different 3D house models can be seen
in Astrolog’s graphic local horizon, chart sphere, and telescope charts. The 3D
house models supported are:</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>1) Prime Vertical:</span> Houses are arranged along
the prime vertical, and have their poles (where the 12 houses meet) at the
North and South points on the local horizon. Note that Campanus houses combined
with this 3D model is a “3D Equal system”, in which all houses are equal sized
30 degree wedges of the celestial sphere. As with 2D Campanus houses, the Ascendant
will always be on the 1st house boundary line, and the MC on the 10th house
boundary line. This is the preferred model for 3D houses (and was the only model
available in versions before 7.30) since for quadrant systems it ensures that
all parts of houses 1-6 are below the horizon, and all parts of houses 7-12 are
above the horizon.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>2) Local horizon:</span> Houses are arranged along the
local horizon, and have their poles at the Zenith and Nadir points straight up
and down on the local horizon. Note that Horizon houses combined with this 3D
model is a “3D Equal system”, in which all houses are equal sized 30 degree
wedges of the celestial sphere. As with 2D Horizon houses, the Ascendant won’t necessarily
be on 1st house boundary line, but the Vertex will always be on the 7th house
boundary line. As with Horizon houses themselves, stepping across the equator
will flip all houses 180 degrees.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>3) Celestial Equator:</span> Houses are arranged along
the celestial equator, and have their poles at the celestial poles or the
points directly above Earth’s North and South poles. Note that Meridian houses
combined with this 3D model is a “3D Equal system”, in which all houses are
equal sized 30 degree wedges of the celestial sphere. As with 2D Meridian
houses, the Ascendant won’t necessarily be on 1st house boundary line, but the
East Point will always be on this boundary.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>0) Ecliptic:</span> Houses are arranged along the
ecliptic, and have their poles (where the 12 houses meet) at the North and
South ecliptic poles. This is classic 2D houses, because signs are also
arranged along the ecliptic and use the ecliptic poles, which means only zodiac
position longitude is used to determine house placement. Passing 0 to the -c3
switch turns 3D houses off, although it doesn’t change which of 1-3 is the
default 3D house model used when the -c3 switch (specified without an argument)
turns 3D houses on. An image of all four house models side by side on the
celestial sphere can be seen at: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/sphere3d.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/sphere3d.gif</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=V>7. Thick lines:</span> Graphics charts may be drawn
with thicker lines, in which all lines will be two pixels instead of just one
pixel wide. This setting will also cause system font characters on graphics
charts to be drawn in boldface. To do this, turn on the new -Xx switch, or
select the new “Thicker Lines” command on the “Graphics / Chart Effects” submenu.
Note when using Astrolog’s default vector glyphs and text, the character and
text scales should be at least 200%, because otherwise the two pixel wide lines
will be too thick to look good with such small characters.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>8. Astro-graph nearest cities:</span> The text mode
astro-graph chart will now display a list of cities from the atlas closest to
each latitude crossing. A second optional parameter to the -L0 switch specifies
the maximum distance allowed from the crossing point to a city, in default
distance units (miles or kilometers). In the Windows version, the new “Latitude
Crossings Show Cities Within” field in the Chart Settings dialog sets this
distance. The maximum number of cities allowed to be listed for each crossing
(which means the N closest cities to it that are within the distance limit) is
specified with the -Nl switch parameter. In the Windows version, the new
“Nearest Cities List This Many Cities” field in Chart Settings sets this
distance.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>9. JPL Horizons custom bodies:</span> Astrolog can
compute planet positions using direct online queries to the JPL Horizons Web
site. The new -Yej switch allows customizing an object slot to be the index of
a JPL Horizons computable body. This feature is designed for objects not yet
supported by Swiss Ephemeris, such as less common planetary moons or space
probes. To determine the JPL Horizons index number for a body, visit <a
href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi</a>,
change the “Target Body” to what you’re interested in by looking up its name,
then click “show ‘batch-file’ data” at the bottom, and finally look at the “COMMAND=”
line to see the number. Note if the number ends in a semicolon (which is true
for asteroids and other minor bodies) then you should add one million to the
number passed to Astrolog. For example, “-Yej Vul 505” will customize Vulcan’s
object slot to be Jupiter’s moon Amalthea, however “-Yej Vul 1000505” will
customize Vulcan to be asteroid “505 Cava”. In the Windows version, in the
“Object Customization” dialog, an object may be given the definition starting
with “j” to refer to the relevant JPL Horizons object. Because every planet
calculation involves an online Web query, this switch results in a noticeable
slowdown of the program, so shouldn’t be used with transit searches or places
that internally cast many charts. Note also that (due to the Windows API’s used
to download Web URL’s) this feature is for now only available in Windows
versions of Astrolog.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>10. JPL Horizons planets:</span> Since Astrolog can
use JPL Horizons to compute special bodies, it can also do so for the standard
planets. The new -bj switch is a calculation mode that will use JPL Horizons
Web queries to calculate the main planets and asteroids. In the Windows
version, there’s a new “JPL Horizons Web Query” option in the “Calculation
Method” dropdown. Since Swiss Ephemeris is a compressed version of JPL Horizons
data, this method can be considered the most accurate astrology calculation
available anywhere, although it will only be very slightly different from Swiss
Ephemeris results themselves. Using this calculation method has the same
performance issues as using JPL Horizons for custom objects. To avoid
accidental usage and unexpected long waits, JPL Horizons Web query features can
be permanently turned off within a session of Astrolog with the new -0n switch.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>11. Decans in wheels:</span> Astrolog’s graphic wheel
charts will display decan boundaries around the wheel, if the new -v3 switch
setting is set. Each sign will have its three 10 degree sections marked out,
and labeled with the planet that rules the sign associated with that section
(based on which rulership set is active).</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>12. Open data files:</span> In the Windows version,
the new “Open Data Files” submenu on the Help menu contains four new commands
to provide access Astrolog’s various editable data files. “Open Atlas” opens
the atlas or city database file “atlas.as”. “Open Time Zone Changes” opens the
time zone definitions and time changes file “timezone.as”. “Open Star List”
opens the Swiss Ephemeris fixed star file “sefstars.txt”. “Open Orbital
Elements” opens the Swiss Ephemeris definitions for hypothetical planets file
“seorbel.txt”.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>13. Window title:</span> In the Windows version, the
title bar text to use for the window can be set with the new -WT switch. This
can be used to mark specific windows or help distinguish a large number of
Astrolog windows from each other.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>14. Sidebar annotations:</span> The sidebar area to
the right of graphic wheel charts can have custom text appended to it. The new -YXt
switch takes a string parameter, which if non-empty gets displayed at the
bottom of the first section of the sidebar. This can for example be used to
indicate who prepared the chart. If the sequence “\n” appears in the string, it
will be treated as a line break. For example -YXt &quot;Compliments of John Doe\nhttp://www.myssite.com&quot;
will show those two lines in the chart. Also, if a sequence like “\A” appears
in the string (or “\” plus any other capital letter) it will be expanded into
the current value of that custom AstroExpression variable. Finally, two
backslashes in a row will be converted to a single one. See the ~Xt switch for
an example of how to use this switch to display the chart time’s obliquity of
the ecliptic and the right ascension of the MC (which normally isn’t present in
the sidebar).</p>

<p class=A>-</p>

<p class=A>Here's a summary of the 10 new command switches in Astrolog 7.30
that weren't in previous versions:</p>

<p class=N><span class=Z>-v3:</span> Like -v but display decan information
alongside positions.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=extend>EXTENDED AND IMPROVED FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A list of improvements to existing features in Astrolog 7.30, such
as new things you can now do with old features that you couldn’t do before, or
ways that existing features work better than before:</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>1. More Unicode fonts:</span> There are three
additional font options for signs, houses, objects, and aspects: Courier New,
Consolas, and Arial. These are different Unicode fonts (and are extensions of
the “Unicode” font option that was available before) in which the appropriate
Unicode characters are chosen. For houses, the Arial font means to use Ascii
digits to draw the numbers, instead of single Unicode characters. The -YXf switch
has been extended to accept these fonts (in which digit #6 is Courier New, #7
is Consolas, and #8 is Arial) and in the Windows version these fonts have been
added to the dropdowns in the Graphics Settings dialog.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>2. More text scales:</span> Scales of 150%, 250%, and
350% are now valid options for the text scale setting (-XS switch, or the “Text
Scale” dropdown in the Graphics Settings dialog in the Windows version). The
150% scale is perhaps most useful, if one finds the default of 100% too small
and 200% too large. Note that the 50% offsets only have an extra effect if an
actual system font is chosen for text (as opposed to Astrolog’s internal vector
drawing).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>3. More fonts in files</span>: Metafile and PostScript
files now support all of Astrolog’s fonts for glyphs, instead of just the Astro
font like before. For PostScript files, the fonts will be “Courier” instead of
“Courier New”, and “Times Roman” instead of “Consola”, to avoid Windows
specific fonts that may not be available in other environments, and to be
compatible with the behavior of older versions.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>4. Planet brightness:</span> The text mode local
horizon chart (-Z switch) will include columns for the planet’s brightness in
magnitude, its phase (both as a percentage of disk area covered, and percentage
of time to fullness), and the angular diameter that its disk covers in the sky.
The Sun Vector and Moon Vector columns (which aren’t that useful anymore given
that Astrolog supports actual eclipse detection) are no longer displayed by
default in this chart, but will still be included if the -v3 switch setting is
on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>5. 3D house display:</span> In the graphic local
horizon chart (-Z -X switches) 3D house boundaries would only be drawn for 3D
Campanus houses. Now they’ll be the 3D version of whichever house system is
active. (The chart sphere and telescope charts already supported this.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>6. Rings of Uranus:</span> The telescope chart (-XZ
switch) will now display rings around Uranus, tilted and rotated appropriately,
when the view is zoomed in enough. An ellipse will be drawn at the most visible
point of Uranus’ rings, specifically at the point of its “E” ring.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>7. Transit declination display:</span> When doing a
transit search of declinations (-d or -t with -gp switches), it will now show
the planet’s declination value at that time in parentheses (instead of just the
zodiac position longitude, which is less useful). Transit events for latitude
direction changes will also now show the latitude instead of zodiac position.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>8. More display settings:</span> In the Windows
version, the Display Settings dialog has been extended to have checkboxes for
having transit search charts show latitude direction changes, and distance
direction changes (e.g. apogee and perigee points) as defined by the -YR1
switch. Also, there’s a checkbox for whether eclipse detection only checks for
an eclipse visible from your location, or checks whether there’s an eclipse
taking place anywhere on the planet, as defined by the -Yu0 switch. Finally,
the Calculation Settings dialog has been extended to have a checkbox for not
applying tropical nutation to charts, as defined by the -Yn0 switch.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>9. Planet table distance format:</span> In the planet
information table (-HS switch) planet diameters will be displayed in kilometers
(instead of the default in Earth radiuses) if the metric lengths setting (-Yv
switch) is on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>10. Flipped sectors:</span> The graphic Gauquelin
sector chart (-l -X switches) will flip the chart and display sectors in
reverse order around the wheel, if the Vedic chart setting is active. This is
similar to existing behavior for standard wheel charts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>11. Swiss Ephemeris updated:</span> Astrolog now uses
Swiss Ephemeris version 2.10.02, which includes support for the new Savard-A
house system along with other fixes and improvements.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=change>PROGRAM CHANGES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A few changes that aren't new feature additions or bug fixes have
been made to Astrolog 7.30, which means certain old assumptions are no longer
valid. Most can be considered improvements, but they still change existing
behavior. A list of these follows (which aren't useful to be aware of unless
you have used previous versions of the program):</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>1. Unicode font removed:</span> Font #4 as passed to
the -YXf switch has been removed (which means the Hamburg and Astronomicon
fonts have had their index numbers moved back by one, and are now fonts #4 and
#5). Similarly, in the Windows version the Graphics Setting dialog dropdowns now
longer contain the “Unicode” option. This has been replaced with several
different specific Unicode fonts one may select: Courier New, Consolas, and Arial
(which are fonts #6, #7, and #8 when passed to the -YXf switch).</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>2. Text decan interface:</span> In the standard text
mode listing when “Print Nearest Second” is on, showing decan positions for
each object (instead of latitude velocity) is now set with the new -v3 switch (instead
of with the -gp parallel aspects setting as before).</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>3. Hyperion moved:</span> Saturn’s moon Hyperion has
been moved two slots later in the object index order since it’s Saturn’s
smallest major moon, and therefore should be at the end of the list of Saturn’s
moons. This also moves moons Enceladus and Mimas back one object slot.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>4. Open Defaults moved:</span> In the Windows version,
the “Help / More Documentation / Open Defaults” menu command has been moved to
a new and different submenu. It’s now the “Help / Open Data Files / Open
Default Settings” menu command.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=bug>BUG FIXES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are bugs or other issues with version 7.20, all of which have
been corrected in 7.30:</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>1. Save Settings corruption:</span> In the Windows
version, the &quot;Save Settings&quot; command would create a malformed file which
when loaded back in would produce an error message saying, &quot;Too few
options to switch /F (1 given, 3 required)&quot;. Also, because of the error,
settings after the error point in the file wouldn’t be read in.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>2. X bitmap crash:</span> The X Windows version of
Astrolog would crash if directed to draw a 24 bit bitmap on the screen, such as
the detailed world maps in the -L or -XG switch charts. Detailed bitmaps aren’t
supported on the screen in this environment, but can still be saved to file.
Now, if directed to do so, Astrolog will automatically fall back to old style
16 color charts for the screen.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>3. Astro font bug:</span> In the Windows version, the
“Astro” font couldn’t be selected in the dropdowns of the Graphics setting
dialog. Attempting to do so would always result in the internal vector font
“Astrolog” instead.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>4. Metafile font corruption:</span> Saving a Windows
metafile format file with system fonts on, would produce a bad file that wouldn’t
display in any environment.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>5. Metafile text scale limitation:</span> System font
text in metafiles wouldn’t respect the text scale setting (-XS switch) which
would result in small text in files that would always be at just 100% scale.
Also, non-Windows versions wouldn’t apply changes made to the text scale via
the -XS switch correctly.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>6. Metafile display glitch:</span> Wheel charts in Windows
metafile format files wouldn’t have spokes line up perfectly with circles,
which could be seen in the lower right quadrant of the chart at high zoom.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>7. Declination transit bug:</span> Doing a transit to
natal search of declinations (-t -gp switches) would only look at ecliptic
latitudes and not equatorial declinations, the latter of which is the standard
for parallel and contraparallel aspects. Also, doing a transit to transit
search of declinations (-d -gp switches) would produce malformed results if the
Equatorial Latitudes setting (-sr0 switch) was on, and convert from ecliptic to
equatorial coordinates twice. Both switches also have the option to check
ecliptic instead of equatorial coordinates, if the -AP switch setting is on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>8. Now LMT bug:</span> Current moment now charts
wouldn’t produce the right chart when the default time zone was set to LMT
(Local Mean Time).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>9. AAF LMT bug:</span> Astrological Exchange (AAF)
format files wouldn’t be imported properly if the time zone was set to Local
Mean Time (LMT), which is indicated by an “L” at the end of the first line of
data. The chart’s Daylight Saving field would be set to 10000 instead of 0, making
the chart off by that many hours.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>10. Apply Info omission:</span> In the Windows
version, in the “Default Chart Info” dialog, the “Apply Info” button would only
update the “Location” text field, and wouldn’t update the time zone and
coordinate fields.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>11. Rising &amp; Setting bug:</span> In the text mode
rising and setting chart (-Zd switch) crossings of the meridian would sometimes
be labeled in reverse (i.e. as a zenith crossing even if below the horizon, and
as a nadir crossing even if above the horizon). This would happen for locations
South of or near the equator, and in the polar zones.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>12. Average velocity inaccuracy:</span> The -v0 switch
setting to display planet velocities relative to their average speed should
compare to the speed of the Sun for inner planets (which orbit closer to the
Sun than the central object) as well as for moons or nodal objects orbiting
those planets. Not doing this would result in permanently slow average velocities
less than 1.0.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>13. Uranian display glitch:</span> In the text mode
local horizon chart (-Z switch), dwarf planet and planetary moon objects would
be incorrectly labeled as in the Uranian object category. In the text mode
solar system orbit chart (-S switch), dwarf planet and planetary moon objects
would be incorrectly labeled as in the fixed stars object category.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>14. Aspect customization limitation:</span> The -YAD
switch wouldn’t change the three letter abbreviation used for the aspect. Also,
the -HA switch to list aspect information wouldn’t show customizations made to
aspect names.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>15. Position file limitation:</span> Astrolog’s chart
position files (as created with the -o0 switch, or the “Save Chart Positions”
command in the Windows version) would save fixed stars by their object index
instead of their names. That made version 7.20 files incompatible with previous
versions, since the insertion of Dwarf planet and planetary moon objects in
version 7.20 changed the index numbers for fixed stars.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>16. Text scrolling glitch:</span> In the Windows
version, scrolling the window to the right and/or down, and then switching to
text mode, would wrongly offset the text by that amount and leave a void area
at the top/left of the window not drawn.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>17. Missing file crash:</span> Astrolog would crash on
program startup if the data files astrolog.as, atlas.as, or timezone.as couldn’t
be found. Usually these files are present, but the bug would still happen if
one deleted them or renamed them to a location not on Astrolog’s search path.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=express>ASTROEXPRESSION UPDATES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>AstroExpressions or “Astrolog Expressions” are programmable
customizations that don’t require recompiling the program, and can be
considered an extended form of command switches. AstroExpression functions and
related command switches have been updated in version 7.30. This section can be
ignored if one doesn’t use this feature area.</p>

<p class=A>The following lists all new AstroExpression functions. The name of
each function is listed, followed by the type of its return value and the
expected types of its parameters (if any). Numbers will automatically be
converted to Integer or Real as needed.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Rgb:</span> Int(IntR, IntG, IntB). RGB color. Returns
an RGB color value, given red, green, and blue color components in the range of
0-255.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>RgbR, RgbG, RgbB:</span> Int(Int): Extract color
component. Returns the red, green, or blue color component of an RGB color
value.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Blend:</span> Int(Int1, Int2, Real): Blend colors.
Returns an RGB color value, given two RGB color values to blend together, and a
real number indicating the proportion between them, in which 0.0 is fully color
#1, and 1.0 is fully color #2.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Hue:</span> Int(Real). Rainbow color. Returns an RGB
color of rainbow. The hue number should range from 0-360, in which 0 is red,
120 is green, and so on around the circle.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>MonN, DayN, YeaN, TimN, DstN, ZonN, LonN, LatN:</span>
Int(Int) or Real(Int): Indexed chart. Like the functions used to access chart information
in specific slots, but returns chart info for the referenced chart slot in the
range 0-6.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>MonS, DayS, YeaS, TimS, DstS, ZonS, LonS, LatS: Int or
Real:</span> Saved chart. Like the functions used to access chart slots, but
returns chart info for the saved or previous chart.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>MonG, DayG, YeaG:</span> Int: Gregorian chart. Like
above but returns the date info currently being used for the Julian to
Gregorian calendar crossover, which by default is October 15, 1582.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjDirL:</span> Real(Int): Object direction Z. Returns
the velocity of an object along the distance axis. There are similar functions
with digit suffixes for chart slots #1 through #6.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>PlusZone:</span> Bool(Int): Gauquelin plus zone.
Returns whether the specified Gauquelin sector from 1-36 is a plus zone.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Nutation:</span> Real: Nutation. Returns the tropical
nutation longitude offset for the most recently cast chart.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Mouse:</span> Int(Int): Mouse coordinates. In the
Windows version, takes the current pixel coordinates of the mouse pointer
(relative to the upper left corner of the Astrolog window) and assigns it to
the two custom variables pointed to by the parameter. Also returns these two
numbers combined together using the formula (Y * 65536 + X). Note the parameter
is usually a static index of a variable, instead of variable value, so should
be in the form %a instead of @a, in order to assign X coordinate to @a and Y
coordinate to @b.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>_w1, _aj, _L1, _L2, _d1, _EY, _E01, _E02, _P1, _N1, _I1,
_c31, _s0:</span> Int: Program setting. This list of functions queries the
Astrolog setting that’s set with the identically named command switch. There are
only a few exceptions or alternate behaviors: Functions ending with “1” or “2”
access the first or second arguments passed to the switch without that digit.
Function _aj accesses the -a switch sort order, with integers 0-8 referencing
the “jonOPACDm” subswitches. Functions _E01 and _E02 both reference the step
parameter to the -E0 switch, in which _E01 is the rate (0=days, 1=months,
2=years) and _E02 is the factor. Function _s0 accesses the -s switch display
format, with integers 0-3 referencing the “zhdn” subswitches.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>_Xx, _Xv, _YXK:</span> Bool or Int or Int(Int): Program
graphics setting. This list of functions queries the Astrolog graphics setting
that’s set with the identically named command switch. The _YXK function takes
one parameter indicating which palette slot to return the RGB color of.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>_WN,  _Wnn, _Wh, _Wt, _Wo, _Wo0, _Wo3, _Wz:</span> Bool
or Int: Program Windows setting. This list of functions queries the Astrolog
Windows version setting that’s set with the identically named command switch. There
is one exception: Function _Wnn accesses the -Wn switch setting, and repeats
the letter of the command switch in its name to avoid a case insensitive name
conflict with _WN.</p>

<p class=A>There are several new command switches which allow one to define
AstroExpression “hooks” into areas of chart calculation or display, to modify
or filter their results. All AstroExpression related command switches start
with the tilde (~) character:</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>1. ~kv &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust wheel section
color. On entry, @x contains the section type (0 = sign, 1 = house, 2 =
Gauquelin sector), @y contains the index (i.e. which sign, house, or sector),
and @z contains the RGB color to use for it based on the -Xv switch setting. Return
value is ignored, although if @z is changed it will be used instead. For
example, to give signs colors of the rainbow, but with red starting at the
Sun’s position in the zodiac, do: <span class=Y>~kv &quot;If Equ @x 0 =z Blend
_YXk ?: _Xr K_White K_Black Hue Sub Mul Dec @y 30 ObjLon O_Sun Div _XI1 100.0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>2. ~v3 &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust decan glyph.
Called when a decan marking is about to be drawn in a wheel chart, as done with
the -v3 switch is on. On entry, @x is the sign from 1-12, @y is the decan
within the sign from 0-2, and @z is the object index to be drawn. Return value
is ignored, although if @z is changed it will be used instead. If @z is
negative, then a sign will be drawn instead of an object. For example, to mark
decans with the signs themselves, as opposed to the planets which primarily
rule the sign, do: <span class=Y>~v3 &quot;=z Dec Neg Mod Add Dec @x Mul @y 4
12&quot;</span> For another example, to mark decans using the Chaldean method,
by repeating the seven visible planets, do: <span class=Y>~v3 &quot;=z Mod Add
Mul Dec @x 3 @y 7 IfElse Equ @z 5 =z 7 IfElse Lt @z 1 =z 5 If Or Equ @z 2 Equ
@z 4 =z Sub 6 @z&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>3. ~Xt &lt;string&gt;:</span> Notify sidebar. Called
when the wheel chart sidebar is about to be drawn. This works well with the
-YXt switch to add computed numeric values to the sidebar. For example, if you
want the current obliquity of the ecliptic and the right ascension of the MC to
always be displayed in the sidebar, do: <span class=Y>-YXt &quot;Obliquity:
\A\nRAMC: \B&quot; ~Xt &quot;=a Oblique =b RAMC&quot;</span></p>

<p class=A>A few improvements, changes, or bug fixes have also been made in the
AstroExpression area:</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>Aspect reordering:</span> The aspect list chart (-a
switch) didn’t display right when object ordering was changed with the ~v
switch AstroExpression.</p>
