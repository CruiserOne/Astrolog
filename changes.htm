<p class=FA>                         **  VERSION 7.60  **</p>

<p class=FA>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=A>Release notes for Astrolog version 7.60 (April 2023):</p>

<p class=A>This file describes the freeware astrology software program Astrolog
version 7.60 and the additions and fixes made to it, over the previous version 7.50
which was released seven months ago in September 2022. The main things in this
update are more fixed star objects, arbitrary distance based aspects, East
Indian charts, and rings of Neptune and Jupiter.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=feature>NEW FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are new additions to version 7.60 that weren't in previous
versions:</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>1. New star objects:</span> The star Algol, the Galactic
Center of our Milky Way galaxy, and Great Attractor location that most nearby
galaxies are being drawn to, have been added to Astrolog as additional objects.
They can be referenced with the -R command switch, and in the Windows version
they’ve been added to the Star Restrictions dialog. Astrolog now has 50 star
slots, and 134 object slots total. “Galactic C.” is object index #132, “Great
Attr.” is object index #133, and “Algol” has been inserted among existing star objects
as index #127. These objects could be computed in Astrolog before, however they
required customization with the -YU switch, so since they’re popular and significant
enough it’s useful for them to be present as default objects.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>2. Star customization:</span> The Windows version has
a new star customization dialog, brought up with the new “Setting / Planetary
Moons / Star Customization” menu command. In it, star object slots can be
renamed, and their definition changed to a new star. Star definitions are
designations as given in the sefstars.txt Swiss Ephemeris text file, and as
passed to the -YU command switch. This dialog is very similar to the Object
Customization dialog, which also allows adjusting the contents of 50 Astrolog
object slots. Any customizations made in this dialog or with the -YU switch
will be saved to a new section in the astrolog.as default settings file, as
created with the -od switch or with the “Save Program Settings” command.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>3. Distance aspects:</span> Astrolog supports “distance
aspects”, or events that compare distances of planets from the observer. Just
as standard aspects compare position along horizontal zodiac position, and Parallel/Contraparallel
aspects compare position along vertical declination, distance aspects consider
the third dimension of distance. To enable distance aspects, use the new -gd or
-ad switches, or the new “Aspects Measure Distance” option in Display Settings.
Distance aspects can be seen in the aspect grid, aspect list, transit
influence, and transit graph charts (both single chart and transit/relationship
comparison charts).</p>

<p class=B>Distance aspects compare proportions or ratios of distance, in which
each aspect’s normal angle indicates the proportion compared to 180. For
example, a “Square” aspect in this context means one planet is 50% of the
distance from the observer as the other (90/180), while a “Sextile” means one
planet has 1/3 the distance of the other (60/180). The “Conjunction” aspect is
used to represent distances being equal, which means there’s never an
Opposition distance aspect in charts (because 180/180 would be redundant). Aspect
orbs become percentages of distance. For example, a 5 degree aspect orb in this
context means planets forming distance aspects are allowed to be up to 5%
different from the exact proportional distance. (One way to distinguish a chart
of distance aspects is that orbs are expressed as percentages instead of
degrees.) For these distance aspects, “waxing” means the nearer planet is
moving away from the observer, while “waning” means the nearer planet is moving
closer.</p>

<p class=B>Also, the “aspects measure distance” setting will extend vertical
aspects. In addition to Parallel/Contraparallel which map to
Conjunction/Opposition, the other aspects can measure other proportions. Each aspect’s
normal angle indicates the proportion compared to 180. For example, a “Square”
aspect in this context means one planet has half the declination of the other
(90/180), while a “Trine” means one planet has 2/3 the declination of the other
(120/180). For these vertical aspects, “waxing” means they’re on the same side
of the baseline, while “waning” means they’re on opposite sides. (Because of
this, Parallel aspects are always waxing, while Contraparallel are always
waning.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>4. East Indian wheel:</span> Astrolog can now display
charts in East Indian format. The East Indian chart is similar to South Indian,
in that by default it has one area for each sign, however by default Aries is
at the top and the signs go counterclockwise around the wheel. Similar to the other
Indian charts, if the “1st house on left edge” setting (-J switch) is on, then
the chart will be rotated so the box containing the Ascendant will be on the
left edge. In Astrolog, the standard wheel chart will be displayed as East
Indian if the “Indian chart format” setting (-XJ switch) is on, and also if the
“adjusted houses” setting (-XC switch) is on.</p>

<p class=B>In the Windows version, to easily select and switch between South
Indian, North Indian, and East Indian wheel formats, there is a new “Graphics /
Indian Style Charts” submenu, with three new menu commands for each of the
three Indian chart types, and each of which has its own keyboard shortcut.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>5. Alternate Eris glyph:</span> Astrolog supports an
alternate glyph for Dwarf planet Eris, which is the Unicode “Form Two” glyph of
a circle below which is a downward pointing arrow. (This is in contrast with
the default “Form One” glyph for Eris of two clashing spear tips.) This
alternate Eris glyph can be selected by passing 2 to the YXGe switch, by
putting 2 in the 1’s place in the -YXG switch, or in the Windows version in the
Graphics Settings dialog by selecting “Eris Glyph / Form Two”.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>6. Nakshatra glyphs:</span> Astrolog can display
graphic glyphs for the Vedic Nakshatras (instead of just numbers for them) when
displaying Nakshatras around the wheel chart, which is enabled when the wheel
sign subdivision type setting is set to Nakshatras (“-v3 9” switch). Vedic
Nakshatra glyphs are in the font “Hank’s Nakshatra” created by astrologer Hank
Friedman. To display Nakshatras using these glyphs, download and install the
font, and then set “Graphics / Graphic Settings / Nakshat.” to “Hank’s
Nakshatra”. They can also be activated by the command switch “-YXfn 9”, which
sets the font to use for Nakshatras to this font.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>7. Individual glyph/font selection:</span> From the
command line, new subswitches of the -YXG switch will set the glyph to use for
individual signs or objects. Specifically, -YXGc will set the glyph for
Capricorn, -YXGu will set glyph for Uranus, -YXGp will set Pluto, -YXGl will
set Lilith, -YXGv will set the Vertex, and -YXGe will set Eris. Also from the
command line, new subswitches of the -YXf switch will set the font to use for
particular things. Specifically, -YXft will set the font for text, -YXfs will
set font for signs, -YXh will set houses, -YXfo will set objects, -YXfa will
set aspects, and -YXfn will set Nakshatras.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>8. Azimuth orientation:</span> The new -YZ switch will
set how azimuth numbers in the text mode local horizon chart (-Z switch) are
determined. By default, azimuth in Astrolog starts at 0 degrees on the East
horizon, passing through 90 degrees on the North horizon. However, alternative true
north-based azimuths start with 0 on the North horizon. The parameter to the
-YZ must be from 0-7, and it indicates where 0 degrees starts, and toward which
direction degrees increase. Each number indicates an additional 90 degrees added
to the azimuth, in which 0-3 means degrees increase counterclockwise when
looking down upon the horizon, while 4-7 increases clockwise. For example, a
parameter of 1 indicates 0 degrees on the South horizon passing through 90
degrees on the East horizon, while 5 indicates 0 degrees on the North horizon
passing through 90 degrees on the East horizon.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>9. Animation command switches:</span> The new -Xnp switch
will pause animation. The new -Xnf switch will set the animation factor, or how
many units of time to jump at a time (taking a parameter from 1-9). Astrolog
has been able to animate charts and pause animation for a long time, however it
wasn’t possible before to manipulate these animation settings via the command
line.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>10. Display message:</span> The new -YYT switch will
popup a message. In the Windows version the text will be in a message box,
while non-Windows versions will print the text to the console. It takes one
parameter, indicating the string of text to display. In the switch’s string
parameter, the character sequence “\n” will be translated to a newline,
character sequences like “\A” will be expanded to the contents of custom
AstroExpression variable @a, and character sequences like “\a” will be expanded
to the contents of custom AstroExpression string indexed by variable @a.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>11. Filter Astrodatabank:</span> The new -Y5i switch
can be used to filter the contents of an Astrodatabank XML file. The switch’s
parameter indicates a string that must be present within a record, in order for
that record to be loaded. This switch is similar to Astrolog’s existing chart
list filtering, however this prevents records from being loaded in the first
place, instead of requiring them to be loaded and then manually removed
afterward, which is faster. It also allows checking records or metadata that
can’t be seen or filtered via other means. For example, to only load those charts
with accurate birth data that are Rodden Rating AA, do: -Y5i &quot;&gt;AA&lt;&quot;</p>

<p class=B>The new -Y5I switch is similar to -Y5i but allows more detailed
filtering based on multiple strings at once. This switch takes two numeric
parameters, which indicate a starting index in the list of AstroExpression
custom variables and strings, and a count of how many AstroExpression variables
to consider from that point. Afterward, when an Astrodatabank XML file is
loaded, each chart record will be scanned for the given strings as indicated in
the AstroExpression custom string list. Each instance of those strings will
cause the corresponding custom variables to be incremented. Finally, the ~5i
switch AstroExpression will be called, allowing the AstroExpression hook to
check the presence of variables to determine which strings have been seen. For
example, assume “-Y5I 4 3”, and in which custom string 4 is “Apple”, custom
string 5 is “Banana”, and custom string 6 is “Carrot”. A chart record
containing two instances of “Apple” and one of “Banana” anywhere within it,
will cause custom variable @d to be 2, @e to be 1, and @f to be 0, when ~5i is
called.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>12. Moons chart setting:</span> Astrolog’s text and
graphic planetary moons charts (-8 switch) may be invoked as -80 to cast each planetcentric
chart separately. This new setting is also in the Moon Object Settings dialog
under the option “true planetcentric positions in moons charts”. Normally (to
have a consistent view of the solar system) a planetcentric chart is the
geocentric perspective of the planet, with the geocentric positions just offset
to that planet. With this setting, the planetcentric chart will be cast
relative to that planet, which may make planets appear slightly differently
than they appear from Earth, due to light travel time to Earth. Note that this
setting only makes a difference for apparent positions, and that if true
positions are on (-YT switch) then -8 and -80 charts will be identical. True
position charts and -80 charts will be virtually identical for planetcentric
positions, since most moons are only a few light seconds away from their
planet.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>13. New house systems:</span> Astrolog supports six
new theoretical house systems. They don’t appear as Windows menu options, but
can be selected via the command line with the -c switch, or in the “House
System” dropdown in the Calculation Settings dialog. Counting these, Astrolog
now supports 40 house systems total.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=extend>EXTENDED AND IMPROVED FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A list of improvements to existing features in Astrolog 7.60, such
as new things you can now do with old features that you couldn’t do before, or
ways that existing features work better than before:</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>1. Rings of Neptune:</span> Astrolog can display the
rings of Neptune, Jupiter, and Dwarf planet Haumea. This is in addition to the
rings of Saturn and Uranus supported by previous versions. Rings can be seen in
Astrolog’s telescope chart and solar system orbit chart, when zoomed in enough
on a planet. For more about rings of planets and how to interpret them in
astrology, see: <a href="https://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/astmoon.htm#ring">https://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/astmoon.htm#ring</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=W>2. JPL Dwarf planet moons:</span> Custom objects in
Astrolog can be defined to calculate the positions of moons of Dwarf planets and
other more obscure objects, by using JPL Horizons Web queries. For example, to
calculate the position of Eris’ moon Dysnomia, set an object to have the
definition of “j120136199”, or pass the number 120136199 to the -Yej switch.
For another example, to calculate the position of comet “C/2022 E3” (the “green
comet”) in astrology charts, set an object to have the definition of “j90004682”
(after which “Lookup Names” should display the body's Name as “ZTF”, standing
for “Zwicky Transient Facility” which discovered it, which is a quick way to
verify the right object has been defined).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>3. Unix JPL Horizons:</span> JPL Horizons Web queries
can be used to calculate standard and more obscure objects on all platforms
now. Before, this feature was only available in the Windows version.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>4. Moons chart extended:</span> Astrolog’s planetary
moons charts are now able to display the moons of Earth, along with moons of Dwarf
planets Eris, Haumea, Quaoar, Orcus, and Salacia. Earth’s moon and Nodes can be
included if these points are first assigned to custom objects, and Salacia’s
moon Actaea can be included if Salacia itself is first assigned to Orcus’
object slot. For example, to display all Dwarf planet moons at once in these
charts (Eris’ Dysnomia, Haumea’s Hi’iaka and Namaka, Quaoar’s Weywot, and
Orcus’ Vanth) use the following command line: -Yej Vul 120136199 -Yej Cup
120136108 -Yej Had 220136108 -Yej Zeu 120050000 -Yej Kro 120090482 -Yej Eri
920136199 -Yej Hau 920136108 -Yej Qua 920050000 -Yej Orc 920090482 _R Vul Cup
Had Zeu Kro Eri Hau Qua Orc</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>5. Moons wheel extended:</span> Astrolog’s planetary
moons wheel chart (-X8 switch) has been extended so that the Moon’s Node and
Lilith objects when unrestricted will be displayed orbiting Earth (assuming a
non-geocentric chart). Since these objects orbit or are positioned around the
Earth, they can be treated the same as if they were additional moons of Earth.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>6. Color Nakshatras:</span> When displaying the 27 Vedic
Nakshatras around a graphic wheel chart, the numbers or Nakshatra glyphs will
now be colored based on the ruler of that Nakshatra. Specifically, starting
with Nakshatra #1, the colors will be that of the objects South Node (Ketu),
Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, North Node (Rahu), Jupiter, Saturn, and Mercury (with
these nine repeated three times).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>7. Local Apparent Time:</span> Astrolog supports time
zone entry in Local Apparent Time (LAT), which is true sundial time. This is similar
to Local Mean Time (LMT), which is a constant rate time based on longitude
difference from GMT. However, since LAT is variable due to Earth’s orbit,
equivalent LAT and LMT times are up to 20 minutes different from each other.
LAT can be specified as a time zone similar to LMT, and appears in Astrolog’s
time zone dropdowns.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>8. Aspect Grid extension:</span> Astrolog’s text and
graphic aspect grid charts respect the display format setting (-s subswitches)
and can have angles and orbs displayed as numbers or hours/minutes (in addition
to degrees that were supported before).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>9. Hourly ephemeris:</span> The text mode ephemeris
listing, when outputting at a step rate different from once per day (-E0
switch) has been updated to allow input by hours. The -E0 switch has been
extended to accept a parameter starting with “h” indicating that many hours,
e.g. “-E0 h8” will output data every eight hours or four times per day.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>10. Houses in dispositor:</span> Astrolog’s dispositor
graph (-j -X switches) will now include house cusp objects in the graph if
those objects are unrestricted, and if the modify display setting (-Xi switch)
is active.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>11. Arabic part ordering improved:</span> Arabic part
sorting order is now a separate setting from whether the Arabic parts chart is
enabled, meaning one can set a sort preference without enabling the chart, or
enable the chart without specifying the sort order (and have the sort order
still apply). The new -Pi switch will sort by default index which groups parts
by category.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>12. Fixed star ordering improved:</span> Fixed star
sorting order is now a separate setting from whether the fixed star object
category is enabled, meaning one can set a sort preference without enabling the
objects, or enable the objects without specifying the sort order (and have the
sort order still apply). The new -Ui switch will sort by default index which
sorts stars by brightness in the year 2000.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>13. Planet absolute magnitudes:</span> The -YUb0 switch
setting which expresses star brightnesses as absolute magnitudes independent of
distance, will now also affect planet magnitudes in the text mode local horizon
chart (-Z switch). For example, Venus is the brightest planet in the sky due to
its close distance to Earth, however if all planets were equal distance then
Jupiter and sometimes Saturn would be brighter.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>14. Print seconds extension:</span> Astrolog’s text
mode aspect list chart (-a switch), influence chart (-j switch), and date
difference chart (-rd switch), will display power, percentage, and time numbers
with more digits to the right of the decimal point, when the print nearest
second setting (-b0 switch) is on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>15. More esoteric interpretation:</span> If esoteric
rulerships, Hierarchical rulerships, and/or Ray rulerships are enabled (-YR7
switch), then chart interpretation will include statements about planets which are
placed in these rulerships, similar to how it does statements about planets in
standard rulerships. Also, Astrolog’s esoteric chart interpretation (-7 -I
switches) will include a sentence about the Hierarchical ruler for each
planet’s sign, similar to how it already includes sentences for the standard
and esoteric rulers.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>16. Esoteric interpretation help:</span> When listing
information about the Seven Rays (-H7 switch), if interpretations are on then
after the Rays are listed, there will be a list of general Esoteric Astrology
information used when interpreting Astrolog’s esoteric chart (-7 -I switches).
Each sign, house, and planet will be listed with its esoteric information.
Specifically, signs will include the esoteric lesson, mundane and esoteric
mantras, and the sign’s type of Light and its corresponding Labor of Hercules.
Houses will include general characteristics and the spiritual qualities they
foster, and planets will include their esoteric meaning.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>17. Relative file paths:</span> The -Yi switches now
support relative file paths, which means a definition like “-Yi natalcharts”
will point to the “natalcharts” subdirectory off of the Astrolog install
directory containing the executable. Downloads of Astrolog now place all
ephemeris files in the “ephem” subdirectory.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>18. Ayanamsa name parsing:</span> Sidereal zodiac ayanamsas
can be specified by name in addition to a particular offset in degrees. For
example, from the command line it’s much easier to do “-s Lahiri” instead of
“-s 0.883208” (although the latter still works). In AstroExpressions, the
various ayanamsa offsets may be referenced by their names prepended with “Z_”,
e.g. constant “Z_Lahiri” means 0.883208.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>19. More complementary aspects:</span> The smart cusps
setting (-YC switch) which avoids redundant aspects between eternally opposite objects
(such as don’t display a Sextile to the South Node if there’s a Trine to the
North Node) has been extended to recognize additional complementary aspect
pairs. The BiQuintile (144 degrees) and SemiQuintile (36 degrees) are
complementary, and the Quintile (72 degrees) and TreDecile (108 degrees) are
also complementary.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>20. More context menus:</span> The Windows version now
has 21 different right mouse click context menus for its various text mode
charts. Before, only graphics mode charts had context menus.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>21. Sorting faster:</span> Sorting chart lists (with
the -5 subswitches, or the “Sort List” button in the Windows version) is now
visibly faster, especially for long chart lists like the Astrodatabank.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>22. TZ database updated:</span> Astrolog’s time zone
change information has been updated to use TZ database version “2023b” (instead
of “2022c” which was used before). This new version has a few subtle
corrections and improvements to various areas in the world.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=change>PROGRAM CHANGES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A few changes that aren't new feature additions or bug fixes have
been made to Astrolog 7.60, which means certain old assumptions are no longer
valid. Most can be considered improvements, but they still change existing
behavior. A list of these follows (which aren't useful to be aware of unless
you have used previous versions of the program):</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>1. Star objects renamed:</span> Astrolog has changed
and renamed its “Pleiades” fixed star object, and now calls it Alcyone, which
is the brightest star in the Pleiades cluster. That star object is no longer
the position of Pleione, a dimmer star in the cluster (which means its position
will move slightly). Also, the fixed star object “Orion” has been renamed to
“Alnilam”, to refer to the middle star in Orion’s belt that it actually refers
to. Also, in constellation charts the fixed star object “Andromeda” would be labeled
“M31”, and now it’s simply “Andromeda” in all contexts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>2. Star objects resorted:</span> Astrolog’s 47 (now
50) fixed star objects have been sorted by brightness, with the brightest star
Sirius first, and the dimmest objects or galaxies last. This affects their
object indexes, and placement in the Star Restrictions dialog. (Specifically
they’re sorted by their brightness in the year 2000, because brightnesses do
change over time gradually due to star proper motion.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>3. Astronomicon font updated:</span> The Astronomicon
font has been updated to version 1.1, and Astrolog makes use of its new glyphs.
Specifically, the glyph for the Quintile aspect now uses the Astronomicon’s new
&quot;Q&quot; glyph, to match Astrolog’s default “Q” glyph for it. That means
displaying the Quintile aspect in Astronomicon within new Astrolog but using an
old version of the font, will result in a bad character. Upgrading to the new
version 1.1 of Astronomicon will fix this. This issue will only be present if
one displays the Quintile glyph in Astronomicon, and can be ignored otherwise.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>4. Moons chart adjusted:</span> Astrolog’s text and
graphic planetary moons charts (-8 switch) used to cast each planetcentric
chart separately. Now (to have a consistent view of the solar system) a
planetcentric reference within these charts is the geocentric perspective of
the planet, computed by taking geocentric positions offset to that planet. This
adjustment may make moons appear at slightly different positions, due to light
travel time to Earth. Note that this change only makes a difference for
apparent positions, and that when true positions are on (-YT switch) the charts
will be identical to before. The old behavior may be accessed with the new -80
switch.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>5. Ephemeris files subdirectory:</span> Downloads of
Astrolog now place all ephemeris files in the “ephem” subdirectory. This can be
done now that the -Yi switch makes it easier to reference subdirectories
relative to the Astrolog install directory.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=bug>BUG FIXES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are bugs or other issues with version 7.50, all of which have
been fixed in 7.60:</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>1. Nodal points inaccuracy:</span> The North Node,
South Node, and Lilith objects would be computed incorrectly, if both
heliocentric mode and the sidereal zodiac were active at the same time.
Specifically, these objects would be offset by the sidereal to tropical zodiac
difference.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>2. AAF time bug:</span> Importing an Astrological
Exchange Format (AAF) file, would parse the chart time incorrectly when country
name ended with the character “a”. Specifically, the time would always be seen
as “am”, in which for example 6pm or 18:00 in the file, would be treated as 6am
or 6:00 by Astrolog.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>3. Bounds bug:</span> In the text mode standard radix
listing (-v -b0 switches), displaying Egyptian/Ptolemaic terms/bounds (“-v3 4”
or “-v3 5” switches) wouldn’t produce the correct planets.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>4. Moons average velocity:</span> The -v0 switch which
displays planet velocities relative to average speed, wouldn’t work right for
planetary moons when a planetary moon was set as the central object, and would
produce abnormally large numbers. For example (similar to how planets are
handled) inner moons of the same planet move at the same average speed as the
planet being orbited (which means the speed the central body moon orbits that
planet), while outer moons of the same planet move at the same average speed as
that outer moon orbiting the planet.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>5. Sidereal time inaccuracy:</span> The display of the
chart’s sidereal time in the center of the text mode house wheel chart (-w
switch) was inaccurate when the sidereal zodiac was active. Specifically, this
time would be offset by the sidereal to tropical zodiac difference.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>6. Aspect grid omission:</span> Aspect grid charts
(other than the text mode single chart grid) would leave out aspects involving
other planets and have blank rows, if the required object setting (-RO switch)
was set. Normally aspect grid charts, since they already display all
unrestricted objects, should show all aspects regardless of the required object
setting.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>7. Transit to natal aspect bug:</span> Transit to
natal aspect velocities (such as in the -aa or -ax switches) normally assume that
the natal planet has zero velocity. However, this check was reversed and incorrectly
assumed the transiting planet in chart slot #2 had zero velocity, as opposed to
the natal planet in chart #1.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>8. Parallel positions display:</span> When the
parallel aspects setting was on, the relationship aspect list (-r0 -ap switches),
and the text mode planetary moons chart (-8 switch), would display vertical
aspect positions as if they were horizontal zodiac positions, producing bogus
numbers. The moons chart will now actually check vertical positions when
parallel aspects is on, showing planetary moon alignments on the vertical axis.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>9. Gauquelin corruption:</span> Displaying the text
mode Gauquelin sector chart would clobber the contents of the first and second
chart slots afterward. That would adversely affect comparison charts displayed
after the sector chart, such as the comparison astro-graph chart. For example,
displaying the sector before the astro-graph chart, with switches like “-r0 -l
-L” or “-r0 -e -L”, would display wrong data for the astro-graph chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>10. Astro-graph inaccuracy:</span> The graphic
astrocartography chart (-L -X switches) would draw nadir lines offset by a couple
pixels to the right of where they should be, when in the left half of the chart.
This could be seen by unrestricting both the North Node and South Node (which
are always 180 degrees opposite each other) and noticing that the North Node MC
line and the South Node IC line weren’t perfectly overlapping.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>11. Wheel coloring limitation:</span> Wheel chart
labels over filled in areas would sometimes be drawn in a color with poor
contrast over the area, especially when the background transparency setting was
set to a high value. Light colored areas will now always be drawn on with
black, and dark colored areas will always be drawn on with white, once the
background transparency reaches 50%.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>12. Sky reflection incomplete:</span> Astrolog’s
graphic local horizon and telescope charts will be drawn flipped from left to
right when the harmonic chart factor is set to -1 (-x -1 switch). However, this
flipping wasn’t applied everywhere, and it wouldn’t also flip the axes and
other chart labeling.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>13. Telescope omission:</span> The telescope chart (-XZ
switch) wouldn’t list Earth/Moon occultations, when they’re seen as such from other
planets.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>14. Telescope display:</span> The telescope chart (-XZ
switch) wouldn’t show the line of the ecliptic, when the colored signs option
(-YXk switch) was also on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>15. Moiré display glitch:</span> The graphic wheel
chart, when the moiré pattern is being drawn in the corners (“-YXv 2” switch),
and also when lines are thick (-Xx switch), would draw a row of extra pixels
below the chart boundary.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>16. COB calculation error:</span> Customizing an
object slot to be a center of body (COB) object, and then making that custom
object be the central body, would result in an error message about two numbers not
being allowed to be identical.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>17. JPL calculation error:</span> Setting the central
object to a custom object computed via a JPL Horizons Web query, would produce
an error message about missing Swiss Ephemeris format ephemeris file (even
though calling JPL Horizons shouldn’t of course involve any ephemeris files).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>18. JPL calculation inaccuracy:</span> A custom object
computed via JPL Horizons, when the central object was something other than
geocentric and also when the sidereal zodiac was active, would be computed
incorrectly and offset by the sidereal to tropical zodiac difference.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>19. Brightness glitch:</span> Adjusting star
brightnesses to be absolute magnitudes relative to a fixed distance (-YUb0
switch) would also adjust the numbers for objects with no brightness such as
the Great Attractor. Those invisible objects should always have their
brightness displayed as 999.99.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>20. Graphic calendar omission:</span> The graphic
transit to transit calendar (-d -K -XA switches) didn't label distance equal
events or latitude zero crossing events.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>21. Graphic calendar display:</span> The graphic
calendar (-K -XA switches) when the thicker lines setting was on (-Xx switch) would
make planets displayed in system fonts only thicker for the first planet, which
would of course look lopsided.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>22. Astronomicon aspect display:</span> When
displaying aspects in the Astronomicon font, Astrolog had the glyphs for
Quintile and Bi-Quintile reversed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>23. Dialog display glitch:</span> In the Windows
version, all dialogs (other than the Chart List dialog) would use a pixelated bitmap
font with no antialiasing to display text within the dialog.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>24. Function key bug:</span> In the Windows version,
invoking macro #10 by pressing the F10 key, wouldn’t engage on the first
keypress, due to F10 by default activating the menu. This key will now invoke
the macro, if one has been defined in that slot.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>25. Object customization bugs:</span> In the Windows
version, customizing an object slot to be a center of body (COB) object, would display
within the dialog as the standard planet (non-COB version) when the dialog is
next opened. Also, defining an object to be a planetary moon implemented by
Swiss Ephemeris, when there’s no ephemeris file for that moon, would cause the
“Check Names” button to produce the name “Orcus” or crash, instead of saying
it’s unknown.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=express>ASTROEXPRESSION UPDATES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>AstroExpressions or “Astrolog Expressions” are programmable
customizations that don’t require recompiling the program, and can be
considered an extended form of command switches. AstroExpression functions and
related command switches have been updated in version 7.60. This section can be
ignored if one doesn’t use this feature area.</p>

<p class=A>The following lists all new AstroExpression functions. The name of
each function is listed, followed by the type of its return value and the
expected types of its parameters (if any). Numbers will automatically be
converted to Integer or Real as needed.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Hue2:</span> Int(Real). Rainbow color. Returns an RGB
color of the rainbow, based on paint color mixing. The hue parameter should
range from 0-360, in which 0 is red, 120 is yellow, 240 is blue, and so on
around the circle.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Char:</span> Int(Int1, Int2). Select character.
Returns the Ascii value of the character within custom string index Int1, at
character position Int2. Returns -1 if the string isn’t set or the character
position is out of range.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DstD, ZonD, LonD, LatD:</span> Real. Default chart
info. Like Dst, Zon, Lon, and Lat, but returns the default set of chart
information.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjXN, ObjYN, ObjZN:</span> Real(Int). Object coordinates.
Like ObjX, ObjY, and ObjZ, but returns the coordinates in space for the
referenced chart slot in the range 0-6.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjRul:</span> Int(Int). Object ruler. Returns the
primary sign that the specified planet rules.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjRul2:</span> Int(Int). Secondary object ruler. Returns
the secondary sign that the specified planet co-rules, or 0 if none is set.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjRulS:</span> Int(Int). Object esoteric ruler.
Returns the primary sign that the specified planet esoterically rules.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjRulS2:</span> Int(Int). Secondary esoteric ruler.
Returns the secondary sign that the specified planet esoterically co-rules, or 0
if none is set.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjRulH:</span> Int(Int). Object Hierarchical ruler.
Returns the primary sign that the specified planet Hierarchically rules.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjRulH2:</span> Int(Int). Secondary Hierarchical
ruler. Returns the secondary sign that the specified planet Hierarchically co-rules,
or 0 if none is set.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjExa:</span> Int(Int). Object exaltation. Returns
the sign that the specified planet is exalted within, or 0 if none is set.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjRay:</span> Int(Int). Object Ray. Returns the Ray
of the specified planet in the range 1-7, or 0 if none is set.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>SignRul:</span> Int(Int). Sign ruler. Returns the
planet that rules the specified sign.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>SignRul2:</span> Int(Int). Sign secondary ruler.
Returns the planet that co-rules the specified sign, or -1 if none is set.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>SignEso:</span> Int(Int). Sign esoteric ruler. Returns
the planet that esoterically rules the specified sign.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>SignEso2:</span> Int(Int). Secondary esoteric ruler.
Returns the planet that esoterically co-rules the specified sign, or -1 if none
is set.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>SignHie:</span> Int(Int). Sign Hierarchical ruler.
Returns the planet that Hierarchically rules the specified sign.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>SignHie2:</span> Int(Int). Secondary Hierarchical
ruler. Returns the planet that Hierarchically co-rules the specified sign, or
-1 if none is set.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>SignRay:</span> Int(Int). Sign Rays. Return the Rays
of the specified sign, with one digit per Ray. For example, Aries is associated
with Rays 1 and 7, so for S_Aries this returns 17.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>SignRay2:</span> Int(IntS, IntR). Sign Ray check. Check
whether the specified sign is associated with the specified Ray. Returns 0 if
not, and a non-zero value if so, specifically the proportion compared to 420
that Ray is present compared to the other Rays also associated with that sign.
For example, “SignRay2 S_Sag 4” returns 140 or 420/3, since Sagittarius is indeed
associated with Ray 4, but also three different Rays in total.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>RayCol:</span> Int(Int). Ray color. Return the
Astrolog color index being used for the specified Ray.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>LATLMT:</span> Real. LAT to LMT offset. Returns the
“equation of time” or the offset in hours between Local Apparent Time and Local
Mean Time, for the moment of the most recently cast chart.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Dlg:</span> Int. Color dialog. In the Windows version,
brings up the Windows color picker dialog. Returns the RGB color selected
within the dialog.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DText:</span> Int(Int, IntX, IntY). Draw text. Draws
the custom string indexed, at the specified coordinates in the current draw
color. Returns the drawing color used.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DSign:</span> Int(Int, IntX, IntY). Draw sign. Draws a
sign glyph, at the specified coordinates in the current draw color. Returns the
drawing color used.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DHouse:</span> Int(Int, IntX, IntY). Draw house. Draws
a house label, at the specified coordinates in the current draw color. Returns
the drawing color used.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DObj:</span> Int(Int, IntX, IntY). Draw object. Draws
an object glyph, at the specified coordinates in the current draw color. Returns
the drawing color used.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DAsp:</span> Int(Int, IntX, IntY). Draw aspect. Draws
an aspect glyph, at the specified coordinates in the current draw color. Returns
the drawing color used.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DNak:</span> Int(Int, IntX, IntY). Draw Nakshatra. Draws
a Vedic Nakshatra label, at the specified coordinates in the current draw color.
Returns the drawing color used.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>_80, _YZ, _Y5I1, _Y5I2:</span> Int. Program setting. This
list of functions queries the Astrolog setting that’s set with the identically
named command switch. There are only a few exceptions or alternate behaviors: Functions
ending with “1” or “2” access the first or second arguments passed to the
switch without that digit.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>_YR0, _YR1, _YR2, _YRZ, _YR7:</span> Bool(Int).
Program setting parameter. This list of functions queries the Astrolog settings
that are set with the identically named command switch. The parameter indicates
which parameter to the command switch to query the status of.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>_Xnp, _Xnf, _YXG, _YXGc, _YXGu, _YXGp, _YXGl, _YXGv,
_YXGe, _YXf, _YXft, _YXfs, _YXfh, _YXfo, _YXfa, _YXfn:</span> Bool or Int. Program
graphics setting. This list of functions queries the Astrolog graphics setting
that’s set with the identically named command switch.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>PC, WIN, X11, WCLI, WSETUP, JPLWEB:</span> Bool.
Program compile time setting. This list of functions returns whether the
correspondingly named compile time #define in astrolog.h was set when the
program was compiled. For example, they can be used to take different actions
in an AstroExpression based on whether the Windows or X11 version is being run.</p>

<p class=A>There are several new command switches which allow one to define
AstroExpression “hooks” into areas of chart calculation or display, to modify
or filter their results. All AstroExpression related command switches start
with the tilde (~) character:</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>1. ~5i &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter Astrodatabank
import. This is only called when the -Y5I switch is set. On entry, the set of
custom variables indicated by -Y5I will be set based on the number of times the
corresponding custom strings were found within the chart record. Return value
is whether to accept the current record in the file, and add it to the chart
list. For example, to only load ADB chart records for people who have at least three
different psychological conditions at the same time, do: <span class=Y>~2 1
&quot;&gt;Diagnoses : Psychological :&quot; -Y5I 1 1 -~5i &quot;Gte @a 3&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>2. ~Q3 &lt;string&gt;:</span> Notify chart displayed.
This is called after a chart has been displayed on the screen and the screen
updated. For example, this hook can be used to display a message to the user
after an update has been drawn and can be seen by the user.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>3. ~XL &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust city color. On
entry, @w is the index of the city, @x and @y are the city’s longitude and
latitude, and @z is the current color to use for it. Return value is ignored,
although if @z is changed it will be the new color to use to display the city’s
point. If this color index is invalid (outside the range of 0-15) then the city
will be skipped and not drawn at all. For example, to only draw those cities within
45 degrees of the chart location, do: <span class=Y>~XL &quot;If Gt PolDist Lon
Lat @x @y 45 =z -1&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>4. ~XQ &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust key. This can be
used to customize key assignments, and is called whenever the user presses a
key in the window. (This only applies to non-Windows GUI versions, in which the
Windows GUI version should instead use the ~WQ switch below.) On entry, @z is
the Ascii value of the key pressed (in which the function keys to invoke macros
have numbers 201-248). Return value is ignored, although if @z is changed it
will be the new key to process instead. For example, to disable the Escape and
Ctrl+c keys so they don’t exit the program, do: <span class=Y>~XQ &quot;If Or Equ
@z 27 Equ @z 3 =z -1&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>5. ~WQ &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust menu command.
This can be used to customize menu command assignments, and is called whenever
the user selects a menu command in the Windows version. (This only applies to
the Windows GUI version, in which the non-Windows GUI versions should instead
use the ~XQ switch above.) On entry, @z is the index of the menu command
selected (as defined in the source file resource.h, with values starting at
40001). Return value is ignored, although if @z is changed it will be the new
menu command to process instead. For example, to make the w/a/s/d keys behave
the same as the arrow keys, do: <span class=Y>~WQ &quot;If Equ @z 40082 =z
40289 If Equ @z 40131 =z 40244 If Equ @z 40281 =z 40290 If Equ @z 40086 =z
40243&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>6. ~2[0] &lt;index&gt; &lt;string&gt;:</span> String
and string list setting. Astrolog has a set of custom string variables,
parallel to its list of custom numeric variables. The ~2 switch will set the
custom string at the given index, to the specified string. If this switch is
invoked as ~20 instead, then it will instead set a range of strings at once,
starting with the index. The first character in the string parameter will be a
separator, in which each instance of that separator character will be a
dividing point between strings. For example, to set custom string 4 to “Apple”,
5 to “Banana”, and 6 to “Carrot”, do: <span class=Y>~20 4 &quot;;Apple;Banana;Carrot&quot;</span></p>

<p class=A>A few improvements or bug fixes have also been made in the
AstroExpression area:</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>More custom variables:</span> AstroExpressions now
support more than 26 custom variable slots. Variables can be assigned to or
read (with the Assign or Var functions) at any index greater than or equal to
0. Variables beyond @a through @z can be referenced by their index numbers,
such as @26 is the same as @z, while @27 and beyond are the new variable slots.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>LonTerm bug:</span> The LonTerm function didn’t work
right in all cases, and wouldn’t return the correct planets for Egyptian or
Ptolemaic terms/bounds.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>_W bug:</span> All AstroExpression functions related
to Windows starting with “_W” incorrectly required a parameter, in which that
parameter would be skipped over and ignored.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>-YXt bug:</span> The -YXt switch to display custom
text in the wheel chart sidebar would stop processing the string after a custom
variable expansion like “\A”, and not display anything more after it.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>~v switch limitation:</span> The ~v object sort order
switch would cause some aspects in the -a aspect list chart to be dropped, when
values are given negative weight. For example, combining -aC or -aD (sorting
aspect list by first or second object position) with ~v &quot;=z Neg @z&quot;
should have just displayed the aspect list in reverse order, but instead it
would only display about half the aspects.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>~U switch limitation:</span> The ~U and ~U0 extra star
and extra asteroid processing switches required the user to make the adjusted zodiac
position longitude be between 0-360, in order for it to work right. These values
can now be anything, and will be automatically wrapped around to fit between
0-360 when needed.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>~d/~t switch limitation:</span> The ~d and ~t transit
event filter switches wouldn’t work fully with the graphic calendar chart (-K
-XA switches), in that deleted transit events would still be present in the
calendar as blank lines, instead of disappearing altogether.</p>

<p class=A>AstroExpressions have now reached the point that they can do general
computing tasks not related to astrology, such as implement games. To
demonstrate this, the script file mazegame.as in the source subdirectory of any
Astrolog download contains a game in which a random Maze is drawn over the
wheel chart, and you use the keyboard to solve the Maze. You can change the
size of the Maze, and the time it takes you to get through is displayed upon
reaching the exit. :)</p>
