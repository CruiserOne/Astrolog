<p class=FA>                         **  VERSION 7.40  **</p>

<p class=FA>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=A>Release notes for Astrolog version 7.40 (March 2022):</p>

<p class=A>This file describes the freeware astrology software program Astrolog
version 7.40 and the additions and fixes made to it, over the previous version 7.30
which was released six months ago in September 2021. The main things in this
update are chart lists, more file formats, Unicode character support, and improved
planetary moon and Esoteric Astrology analysis.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=feature>NEW FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are new additions to version 7.40 that weren't in previous
versions:</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>1. Chart lists:</span> Astrolog 7.40 introduces the
major new feature area of “chart lists”. This means being able to store an
arbitrary length list of sets of chart information. (This list is separate from
Astrolog’s standard chart slots which are used to display wheels, bi-wheels,
and so on.) Once loaded into the program, a chart list can be inspected,
edited, displayed, and more. Here are various features that work with
Astrolog’s chart list:</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Open chart list:</span> The easiest way to get a chart
list is to load one from file. Astrolog’s “File / Open Chart” menu command (and
-i switch on the command line) can accept various file formats containing chart
lists. They include Quick*Chart format files, Astrodatabank format XML files,
Solar Fire text export format files, and AstroExchange (AAF) files when
multiple charts are present in sequence. These formats are described in more
detail below at the start of the “Extended and Improved Features” section.
Astrolog also has its own chart list format which can be loaded, described
below. All these formats can also be pasted into the Windows version from the
Windows clipboard using the “Edit / Paste” command.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Open chart directory:</span> Before version 7.40,
Astrolog always stored every set of chart information in a separate file. Some
may have directories containing hundreds of Astrolog chart information files!
Astrolog can read a directory, and open every *.as extension file within it
into the program’s chart list. (This will automatically skip the special
Astrolog files astrolog.as, atlas.as, and timezone.as if present.) Select a
directory with the “File / Other Formats / Open Charts in Folder” menu command,
or on the command line with the new -id &lt;directory&gt; switch. If the -Yo old
file format switch is in effect, then Astrolog will open every single file in
the directory (which should be used with care, since it will produce errors if
files other than Astrolog chart information files are present in that directory).</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Save chart list:</span> Charts lists in memory can be
saved to several different formats. The new “File / Other Formats / Save Quick*Chart”
menu command (and the new -oq switch on the command line) will save the list to
Quick*Chart format. The “File / Other Formats / Save Chart Exchange” menu
command (-oa switch on the command line) will save the chart list to a sequence
of AstroExchange format (AAF) records. The new “File / Other Formats / Save
Chart List” menu command (and the new -ol switch on the command line) will save
to Astrolog’s own chart list format. If the chart list is empty, then these
commands will save a length 1 list consisting of the chart in standard slot #1.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Iterate chart list:</span> In the Windows version, one
can easily display the different charts in the chart list with the commands on
the new “Info / Chart List” submenu. The “Previous Chart” and “Next Chart”
commands (accessible via the Shift+Up and Shift+Down hotkeys) will display the previous
or next chart in the list, which means the appropriate chart from the chart
list will be copied into main chart slot #1, and be displayed in the wheel or
other chart context. (The program will remember the index of the most recent
chart list entry displayed.) Also, the “First Chart” and “Last Chart” menu
commands (accessible via the Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down hotkeys) will jump to
showing the first or last charts in the chart list.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Chart list dialog:</span> In the Windows version, the
new “Info / Chart List / Chart List” menu command will bring up a dialog
showing the current chart list. In this dialog, one can see the list of sets of
chart information, and the number of entries in the list. One may select a
chart and click OK to copy that chart list entry into Astrolog’s chart slot #1
and display it. One may also select a chart slot, and use the “Set To Slot”
button to copy the chart list entry to that slot, or use the “Copy From” button
to append the chart information in that slot to the end of the chart list
(which will do nothing if the charts are the same, to prevent duplicates). One
can also select a chart slot, and use the “Edit Chart” button to view and
change the information using the “Set Chart Info” dialog, or use the “Delete
Chart” button to delete it from the chart list. The “Delete All” button will empty
the entire chart list, such that the list size will be 0. Note that opening
chart list files will not delete the existing chart list first (to allow one to
append lists together) so deleting the list is necessary if one wants to start
from a clean slate. Finally, the “Sort By” and “Filtering” sections allow one
to sort the list, or filter the list to only display certain charts, as
described in more detail below.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Sort chart list:</span> The chart list can be sorted
in five different ways: By date (earliest to latest), by longitude (from
farthest West to farthest East), by latitude (from North to South), by name
string alphabetically, and by location string. In the Windows version, the
chart list can be sorted in the Chart List dialog by selecting the method and
then pressing the “Sort List” button. On the command line, the five sorting methods
can be selected with the new -5d, -5x, -5y, -5n, and -5l command switches. Note
that sorting will affect the list in memory, and therefore remain in effect if
the chart list is subsequently saved to file. There’s also a user customizable
method of sorting, accessible via the -5s command switch, which will call the
~5s AstroExpression (described later) to decide how to sort.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Filter chart list:</span> The chart list can be
filtered, to display a subset of the charts in it. This is useful to focus upon
a set of charts in long lists. In the Windows version, the chart list can be
filtered in the Chart List dialog, by entering Name and/or Location strings
which must be present in the chart, and then pressing the “Filter” or “Remove
Filter” buttons. On the command line, filtering can be done with the new -5f command
switch, which takes name and location string parameters. In both scenarios, the
name or location strings can be empty, in which case filtering is only done
upon the other parameter. The command line will always affect and reduce the
number of charts in the list in memory, however in the Windows version
filtering won’t affect the list in memory if the dialog is OK’ed with a filter
active (which means filtering to select the chart you want won’t affect the
chart list, however OK’ing the dialog with a filter on but no chart selected is
a way to permanently affect the chart list). There’s also a user customizable
method of filtering, accessible via the ~5f AstroExpression (described later),
which (similar to the name and location fields) will also set a condition that
must be met by charts in order to be present post-filtering.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Command lines:</span> Chart lists can also be composed
and worked with from the command line. The new -il subswitch is like -i, except
the file loaded will have its chart information appended to the chart list.
Similarly, the new -ql switch is like -q, except the chart information
specified will be appended to the chart list. The new -qL switch will do the
reverse, and cast a chart based on the specified index in the chart list (chart
indexes start with 0). The new -qc switch takes 10 parameters to fill out all
fields of chart information, including name and location strings. (It’s like a
combination of -qb which sets the eight pieces of data, and -zl which sets name
and location.) When saving a chart list to Astrolog’s own chart list format,
the file will consist of a sequence of -qcl switches, which when loaded back in
will define the complete sets of chart information and append them to the chart
list. The new -50 command switch will delete the entire chart list, such that
the list size will be 0.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Display all charts in list:</span> The new -5e switch
will display all charts in the chart list in sequence, in text mode. This will produce
one stream of text, in which the display options selected will be done for each
chart, e.g. “-g -a -5e” will display the -g aspect grid and -a aspect list for
each chart in the list. Beware that combining -5e with -e will produce a huge
amount of output, e.g. “-5e -e” on the entire Astrodatabank will produce 5
gigabytes of output. The new -5e2 switch is similar, except it will set chart
slot #2 to each chart in the list, instead of just the main slot like -5e does.
For example, “-5e -rt” will display each chart in the list transited to the
time in slot #2, while “-5e2 -rt” will display the main chart transited to each
time in the chart list. The -5e3 switch will do a grid of charts, and cover
every combination of different charts, such that each chart is matched with
each other chart exactly once, e.g. “-g -5e3” will display aspect grids for
each combination of charts. Finally, -5e4 is like -5e3 but will do each
combination period (which will include each chart being compared with itself, and
each pair of charts will be matched with each other twice in different orders).
Beware that -5e4 can produce an enormous amount of output, e.g. “-5e4 -r0 -g”
on the entire Astrodatabank will produce over 4 billion different aspect grids!</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Autocreate chart list:</span> The new “Times Populate
Chart List” checkbox in the Transits dialog (-5 switch on the command line)
will set a special mode such that any chart that produces a list of times will
automatically populate the chart list with those events (replacing the existing
list if already present). This includes the -d transit to transit times, -t
transit to natal times, and -Zd rising and setting charts. This useful feature
allows one to produce things such as a list of Full Moons during the year, or
one’s solar returns for the next decade, and then use the arrow keys to display
and navigate through all these different calculated charts in the chart list.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Enumerate all charts in list:</span> For technical
users who work with AstroExpressions, there’s a quick way to automatically loop
over all charts in the chart list. The obscure -Y5 switch (which can also be
invoked as -5Y which does the same thing) will loop over all charts in the
chart list in sequence. It’s very similar to -5e in that it can be invoked as
-Y5, -Y52, -Y53, and -Y54 to loop in different manners, except it won’t display
the charts cast. This switch only has effect when the ~5Y AstroExpression has
been defined to look at the charts. See the ~5Y switch description for more
details. This is designed to analyze the chart list, to perhaps determine data
to use for later filtering via -5f and ~5f, and then displaying via -5e. For
example, if you want to display all charts in the chart list with the most
number of Trines to your natal chart, you first need to determine the most
number of Trines any chart has (which can be counted using -Y5 and ~Y5), and
the filter the chart list to those chart(s) containing that many Trines (using
-5f and ~5f), and then the filtered chart list can be displayed with -5e.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>2. Graphic planetary Moons chart:</span> Astrolog’s
planetary moons chart can now be displayed in graphical form. Select “Setting /
Planetary Moons / Moons Chart” with “View / Show Graphics” on (or use the -8 -X
command switch combination). The graphic planetary moons chart shows planetary
moon placement and aspects in graphical form. Like the text mode planetary
moons chart, this will show the positions of unrestricted moons, or all moons
if all moon objects are restricted. The chart itself is divided into four circular
parts, and shows top and side views from both geocentric and heliocentric
perspectives. Front views are like Astrolog’s telescope chart viewing the
planet from the perspective of the current central body, and show prominence
zones making it easy to see whether a moon is leading, following, above, or
below its planet. Top down views are like Astrolog’s solar system orbit chart
looking down upon the ecliptic plane, and show prominence zones making it easy
to see whether a moon is leading, following, close to, or distant from its planet.
All views have a central circle which indicates the planet itself, in which a
moon will only be displayed within the circle if it’s actually eclipsing
(transiting over or occulted by) the planet from the perspective in question.
If the chart includes moons from multiple planets, they will be overlayed
within each area.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>3. More aspects:</span> Astrolog has added six new
aspects, increasing its total number of supported aspects from 18 to 24. The
new aspects are the TriDecile (108 degrees, or 3/10 of a circle) and all the
11th harmonic aspects (Undecile, BiUndecile, TriUndecile, QuatroUndecile, and QuintUndecile,
for 1/11, 2/11, 3/11, 4/11, and 5/11 of a circle). These aspects have glyphs
similar to those for Septiles and Noviles, which in this case is the number 10
or 11, with a Roman numeral two through five over it if appropriate. With these
additions, Astrolog supports all aspects up through the 12th harmonic, or all
possible aspect combinations that are x/y of a circle, where y is 12 or less.
These new aspects can be turned on or off or customized in the Aspect Settings
dialog, or through existing command switches.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>4. Waxing/waning aspects:</span> Astrolog now supports
displaying aspect orbs as waxing or waning. Waxing means the overall difference
between the two planets is increasing, while waning means the difference is decreasing.
(Compare waxing/waning to applying/separating orbs in which the exact aspect is
about to happen or has just happened, or to positive/negative in which the
current angle is greater than or less than the aspect’s angle.) Waxing/waxing
can be selected via a new radio button group in the Display Settings dialog, or
else on the command line by the -gx or -ax subswitches when selecting the -g
and -a switch aspect charts. All three types of orbs can be seen in the -g
aspect grid chart, the -a and -D aspect list charts, and the -t and -T transit
to natal charts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>5. Character encoding:</span> Astrolog now allows one
to specify the character encoding or codepage of text strings that are read
into the program and stored internally. There are multiple methods to store
special characters other than low-Ascii text, and in previous versions this could
sometimes cause special characters to display incorrectly in Astrolog text mode
or graphics mode charts. The character encoding can be selected in the Display
Settings dialog, or with the numeric digit subswitch to the new -Ya switch
(i.e. -Ya0 through -Ya3). This can be an important issue because chart
information files or even content within strings on the command line needs to specify
how to handle high Ascii bytes that are present. The four options are:</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>0) Default:</span> This means don’t treat content as
in any particular encoding, never do any character translation, and treat
things the same way as in previous versions of the program. In previous versions,
there was no character encoding anywhere. For example, Astrolog graphics charts
would assume characters were in the common Latin-1 codepage, however Astrolog
text mode charts emulate a command prompt and display using an old IBM
codepage, so special characters that display right one in one context wouldn’t
in the other. This setting will still do translation in places where it’s
absolutely required, such as when reading in Astrodatabank XML files which are
known to be encoded in UTF8.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>1) IBM / DOS:</span> This means the encoding used by
old IBM and DOS computers, sometimes called the OEM codepage or codepage 437,
which is still used today within most Windows command prompts. Unix users and
even most Windows users should avoid this, however this option is still present
because those who primarily run the Windows command line version of Astrolog
from command prompts (which use this codepage by default) may have old chart
information files that store special strings in this manner.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>2) Latin-1:</span> This means the common encoding used
by most of the Western world, called Codepage ISO-8859-1 or Latin-1 (or more
technically Windows-1252, which is a superset of it which also defines
characters in the 128-159 byte range). For example, this is used when viewing
plain Ascii text files in Windows Notepad, or characters in classic Unix
command prompts (that don’t already support UTF8). Therefore, this is the
generally the simplest option that will work in most cases. Like #1, this is a
single byte codepage, so only covers 256 possible Unicode characters, which
means other characters will be displayed as “?” if necessary. Some file formats
are always saved in this format, such as PostScript and Windows metafiles.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>3) UTF8 Unicode:</span> Unlike #1 and #2, this is a
multibyte codepage, which uses two or three bytes to encode high-Ascii and high
Unicode characters greater than 127. Because this can cover the entire Unicode
range, this option can display East Asian and other special characters. These special
characters are available when saving to HTML output, and for graphics charts on
the Windows screen when using system fonts. When Astrolog saves text chart in
UTF8, the first three bytes in the file will be the special UTF8 byte order
mark (BOM) which indicates the file is in that format (which most text readers
that understand UTF8 will automatically skip over).</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Output encoding:</span> The setting above will not
internally change the byte content of strings, but rather it affects how
they’re displayed. (That means if special characters ever display incorrectly
or as garbage character sequences, changing the character encoding setting will
likely fix it.) There’s a parallel setting defined by the new -Yao switch used
to set the encoding for how strings should be output to file (i.e. -Yao0
through -Yao3). Combined with the input encoding defined by -Ya, this can allow
one to do codepage conversions, for example if they want to convert an Astrolog
chart information file known to be in one encoding, into a different encoding.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>6. Store/Recall restrictions:</span> The new -YRo switch
will store and remember a copy of all restrictions. The new -YRi switch will do
the reverse and recall and restore the most recent set of restrictions saved
with -YRo. This includes object restrictions, transiting object restrictions,
aspect restrictions, sign and direction restrictions, rising/setting angle
restrictions, and rulership set restrictions. This is useful for scenarios such
as automatically finding the time of and displaying the chart for an event, in
which one first restricts all objects to the set necessary to find the event,
and then later restores the original set for displaying the chart. For example,
to display the chart for the Full Moon this month, do: astrolog -Yq2 &quot;-n
_e =dm -YRo -R0 Sun Moo -RA0 Opp -YR0 1 1&quot; &quot;-i set _e -YRi&quot;</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>7. Add hours:</span> The new -+t and --t switches will
add or subtract the specified number of hours to the chart being cast. Decimal
numbers are accepted for partial hours. They work similarly to the existing -+m
and -+y switches which adjust a chart by the given number of months or years.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>8. New dialog fields:</span> In the Windows version,
several new fields have been added to dialogs for easier access to certain
settings that were already in the program, but only accessible before using the
command line. In the Calculation Settings dialog, there’s a dropdown for the
current house system (which is equivalent to the Setting / House System
submenu, but also contains additional experimental systems). In the Chart
Settings dialog, there’s a checkbox for whether the standard radix chart shows
decan positions (-v3 switch), and a dropdown for what to sort the aspect list
chart by (-a subswitches). In the Graphics Settings dialog, there’s a field for
the solar system orbit trail length (-YXj switch), a field for the solar system
orbit and telescope zoom scale (-YXS switch), checkboxes for whether the
display of the full star list includes bigger dots and name labels (-XU
subswitches), and a dropdown for how to color cities from the atlas (-XL
subswitches).</p>

<p class=A>-</p>

<p class=A>Here's a summary of the 24 new command switches in Astrolog 7.40

<p class=Section><a name=extend>EXTENDED AND IMPROVED FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A list of improvements to existing features in Astrolog 7.40, such
as new things you can now do with old features that you couldn’t do before, or
ways that existing features work better than before:</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>1. Quick*Chart import:</span> Astrolog can import Quick*Chart
format files. Such files can be selected with the -i switch, selected in the
Windows version Open Chart dialog, or even be pasted in from the Windows
clipboard. This format stores multiple charts, and so will populate Astrolog’s
chart list (and the last chart read will be put into chart slot #1, so a file
containing just one chart is immediately displayed). This file format usually
has the “.qck” extension, and contains a simple text list of charts in fixed
width fields, with each line containing 100 characters. Files are recognized as
Quick*Chart format because their lines are always 100 (or sometimes 101)
characters long.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>2. Astrodatabank import:</span> Astrolog can import
Astrodatabank format files. Such files can be selected with the -i switch,
selected in the Windows version Open Chart dialog, or even be pasted in from
the Windows clipboard. This format stores multiple charts, and so will populate
Astrolog’s chart list (and the last chart read will be put into chart slot #1,
so a file containing just one chart is immediately displayed). These are XML
format files with an advanced schema containing records for a variety of
astrological data, although only fields corresponding to Astrolog’s chart
information fields will actually be read in. Files are recognized as
Astrodatabank format because their first character is “&lt;” for a HTML-like
tag. The Astrodatabank can be viewed online at <a
href="https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/">https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/</a>
and the actual Astrodatabank XML itself (of which the full database currently
contains 65258 charts in a large 187MB file) can be downloaded from: <a
href="http://www.astro.com/adbexport/">http://www.astro.com/adbexport/</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=W>3. Solar File import:</span> Astrolog can import text
files created by astrology program Solar Fire. Such files can be selected with
the -i switch, selected in the Windows version Open Chart dialog, or even be
pasted in from the Windows clipboard. This format stores multiple charts, and
so will populate Astrolog’s chart list (and the last chart read will be put
into chart slot #1, so a file containing just one chart is immediately displayed).
This doesn’t mean the actual Solar Fire file binary format which has the “.SFcht”
extension. Instead, Astrolog can import Solar File’s text file export, which is
created in Solar File by doing “File / Open / Chart Database / Send/Add / Email
All Charts”. Make sure “Attach chart file to email” and “Text File” are turned on,
and “Include chart comments” and “Include life events” are off. The human
readable “charts.txt” attachment produced is what can be loaded in to Astrolog,
which is a quick way to transfer a Solar File chart database into Astrolog.
Files are recognized as Solar Fire export format because their first line is
blank, followed by records for each chart which are lines for name, time, and
location, separated by blank lines.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>4. AstroExchange list import:</span> Astrolog can
import multiple charts at once that are stored in the AstroExchange (AAF)
format. Astrolog could open AAF format files in previous versions, but would only
read a single chart. Now, a sequence of AAF records in the same file will be
loaded into the chart list (and the last chart read will be put into chart slot
#1, so a file containing just one chart will still be immediately displayed). For
example, the <a href="http://www.astro.com">http://www.astro.com</a> site can
show saved charts in AAF format, if you click the “aaf” button in the “Stored
Astro Data” section of your profile. Once there, you can simply select the
lines of AAF text for one or more charts, copy it to the clipboard, then do
“Edit / Paste” in Astrolog for a quick way to transfer your Astro.com profile
charts into Astrolog.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>5. Graphic transit calendar:</span> Astrolog’s graphic
calendar when showing aspects within each day box (-K -XA switches) will show
transit to natal aspects when in a comparison chart mode, showing aspects
between the transiting date (such as set in the Transits dialog) and the natal
chart. For example, turn on the “Info / Comparison Chart” menu command (-r0
switch) to show it. This will do progressed to natal instead if in “Progressed
to Natal” node (-rp switch). To distinguish this from standard transit to
transit calendar aspects, transiting planets will be flagged with a “T” prefix,
and progressed planets with a “P” prefix.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>6. House influences:</span> Astrolog’s influence chart
(-j0 switch) now includes house influences in addition to sign influences. A
list of houses ranked by influence will be displayed separately from the
existing list of signs ranked by influence. This will also include summaries
for the four house “elements” (called Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha houses in
Vedic astrology), and the three house “modes” (Angular, Succedent, and Cadent).
Each house has a base influence, and houses also receive influence based in the
influence of the planets within them. Because house influences are now tracked
separately, sign influences no longer receive influence if a planet is in the
corresponding house (e.g. a planet in the 10th house no longer adds influence
to Capricorn). The old behavior of only tracking sign influences is still
available if the -l0 switch is in effect. Also, sign influences now have the
option to add influence to the decanate sign placements of each planet, if the
-v3 switch is in effect.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>7. Esoteric interpretation:</span> Astrolog’s Esoteric
Astrology chart (-7 switch) will display a special Esoteric Astrology interpretation
when interpretations are turned on. For each planet in sign placement, Astrolog
will display the esoteric meaning of the planet, the Ray of the planet and its
meaning, the esoteric lesson of the sign, the mundane and esoteric mantras of the
sign, the spiritual type of Light of the sign, the sign’s associated Labor of
Hercules, the mundane/exoteric and esoteric ruler(s) of the sign, along with
the sign’s Ray(s), and any standard, esoteric, or Ray rulerships. If the “text
influence chart shows sign influences too” setting (-j0 switch) is on, then
house placement will be esoterically interpreted too. Astrolog will display the
esoteric meaning of the house, the Ray(s) of the sign corresponding to the
house, and any house Ray rulerships.</p>

<p class=B>Also included is an esoteric “Ray chart” for the person or time in
question. A true Ray chart can’t be determined objectively, but it’s possible
to give clues or hints to a Ray chart based on astrological influences.
Displayed will be the potential Rays for soul, personality, mental vehicle,
astral vehicle, and physical vehicle. For each vehicle, each of the Seven Rays
is given a score, and these Rays and their percentages are displayed in order.
Each vehicle focuses upon two or three planets that align with it, which may
include Earth and Vulcan, so for best results these objects should be
unrestricted. For the planets in question, the Ray vehicle score calculating process
looks at the Rays of the planet’s sign, along with the Rays of the exoteric and
esoteric rulers of the sign (and the Rays of their dispositors or planets which
rule those signs). Some signs have multiple or veiled exoteric or esoteric
rulers, in which case both lines are considered. If the “standard radix chart
shows decan positions” setting (-v3 switch) is on, then also considered will be
the sign based decanates. (This means looking at four things: Standard sign
placement and ruler, along with 1/3 score for the decanate placement of the
sign ruler, 1/3 score for the sign of the ruler of the decanate, and 1/9 score
for the decanate placement of the decanate ruler.) Finally, for the three
vehicles, Rays are proportioned to align with the common distribution of Rays
for those vehicles: Physical Ray is usually 7, 3, or 1. Astral Ray is usually
6, 2, or 1. Mental Ray is usually 5, 3, 4, or 1.</p>

<p class=B>The text used for the mantras, spiritual Light, and Herculean Labors
is from the book “Esoteric Astrology” by Alice A. Bailey. The text used for
esoteric planet meanings, esoteric sign lessons, and esoteric house meanings,
along with the main design logic of the astrological influences Ray chart
itself, is by Esoteric Astrologer BL Allison.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>8. Esoteric years graph:</span> The Ray ephemeris
(i.e. the graphics version of the esoteric chart, or the -7 -X switches) can
now display multiple years instead of just one. Similar to the graphic standard
ephemeris, the Ray ephemeris will look at the “Years to Span” field in the
Transits dialog (or the -EY switch setting on the command line).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>9. Planetary moons interpretation:</span> Interpretation
of the planetary moons chart (-8 -I switches) now will include interpretations
for the meanings of moons in prominence zones, i.e. moons that are leading,
following, close, or distant from their planet.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>10. Progressed ephemeris improved:</span> The text and
graphics mode ephemeris charts (-E switch) now work better with progressions, when
displayed with progressed mode on. The ephemeris will now show a progression of
the fixed natal chart to the span of dates covered in the ephemeris, instead of
just graphing a changing natal chart to a single fixed progression date.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>11. Transit influence orb options:</span> The transit
influence charts (-D and -T switches) can now display aspect orbs in terms of
positive/negative difference, applying/separating in time, or waxing/waning in
offset, based on the value of the -aa and -ax switch settings. Before, these
charts always only displayed applying/separating. Positive/negative orbs will
be prefixed with “pos” or “neg”, applying/separating will be prefixed with
“app” or “sep”, and waxing/waning with “wax” or “wan”.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>12. Astro-graph transits:</span> The text mode
astrocartography chart (-L -r0 switches) now has a version that displays when
in relationship comparison mode. This relationship astrocartography chart will
map the lines of both sets of planets separately, and indicate latitude
crossings or parans where one chart’s lines crosses the other chart’s lines.
For example, this can do a relationship comparison between two people and see
where their lines cross, or compare between transit and natal charts to see how
current energies are affecting one’s natal energies. Each line will be marked
with “#1” or “#2” to indicate the two chart slots, or else be marked with “T.”
or “P.” or “N.” to indicate transiting, progressed, or natal.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>13. Astro-graph angle restrictions:</span> The text
mode astrocartography chart (-L switch) will now respect the rising and setting
restrictions, which when set will prevent the display of latitude crossings
involving the Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant, or Nadir.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>14. Astro-graph Fortune:</span> The Part of Fortune
will now appear in the text and graphics mode astrocartography charts, as well
as in the world map and globe charts. This object used to always be prevented
from appearing, however it can be plotted in the sky since it has a definite
longitude and latitude. (The Part of Fortune’s latitude is normally 0, but if
the 3D houses setting is on it will have its latitude also set using the Part
of Fortune’s formula.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>15. Telescope labeling:</span> The graphic telescope
chart (-XZ switch) and local space chart (-Nl -X switches) will label the axes
on the edges of the chart to the nearest arcsecond, if the chart is zoomed in
enough. Before, the edges would only display markings to the nearest arcminute,
which might not show anything at high zooms.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>16. Aspect table ordering:</span> The list aspects
help table (-HA switch) will now also include a list of all aspects in order of
their angle in degrees. This will list the number of degrees covered by each
aspect based on the aspect’s orb, along with the number of degrees covered by
the gaps between aspects. If any aspects are defined with wide enough orbs so
that their areas overlap, this condition and the amount of overlap will be
indicated. (When overlap causes more than one aspect to be valid, Astrolog will
choose the aspect with the earlier index to be in effect.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>17. More headers:</span> Text mode charts now include
more informative headers. For example, relationship modes of charts such as the
aspect grid and aspect list will display header information for both charts,
instead of just the first chart. The text mode relationship list (-v -r0 _X
switches) will include header lines for the cities and longitude/latitudes, in
addition to just the names and dates. Also, when progressed mode is on, the date
being progressed to will be included.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>18. Larger internal font:</span> Astrolog’s internal
vector graphics text can now be displayed at odd text scales such as 150%.
Before, the 50% offsets only had a different effect if an actual system font was
chosen for text. To support this, Astrolog has a new internal font 150% size of
its standard font, which it uses for this scale.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>19. New Vertex glyph:</span> Astrolog can display a
new Vertex glyph, which is the abbreviation “Vx”, which in current years in the
most common form of this glyph. Astrolog can still do its classic Vertex glyph
of a cross with split ends. Either glyph can be selected with a new option in
the Graphics Settings dialog, or with the -YXG switch (in which the Vertex
glyph is selected by the 1’s place digit, which means the other glyphs have all
been moved “left” one digit). For example, -YXG 1 will be the classic Vertex
glyph, while -YXG 2 will be the new “Vx” glyph.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>20. Eclipse aspect glyphs:</span> Astrolog can display
special aspect glyphs indicating eclipses, in which a filled in Conjunction
glyph indicates a solar eclipse or occultation, and a filled in Opposition
glyph indicates a lunar eclipse. These glyphs are available in Astrolog’s
default font, and the filled in Conjunction is available in the Hamburg font. Eclipse
glyphs can be seen in Astrolog’s aspect graphic grid, calendar, and transit graph
charts (-g, -K, and -B switches).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>21. More Astro glyphs:</span> The Astro font will now
display glyphs for the objects Chiron and Lilith. The Astro font has always contained
these glyphs, but Astrolog used to always display its own default glyphs for
these characters instead.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>22. No sidebar houses:</span> The graphic sidebar for
wheel charts won’t list the 12 house cusp positions when the house system is
set to Null. That’s because the Null system has the 1st house always at 0Aries,
so its position and that of the other cusps is obvious. This can be used as a
way to remove listing the cusp positions, if one wants more room to list the
planets below them.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>23. More ayanamsas:</span> In the Windows version, the
“Zodiac Setting / Ayanamsa” dropdown has been populated with five additional
sidereal zodiac ayanamsas: Deluce, Usha-Shasi, Yukteshwar, J.N. Bhasin, and
Galactic Center (in which the Galactic Center is at 0Sag). The offsets of existing
ayanamsas have been adjusted slightly to more accurately reflect how Swiss
Ephemeris computes them, although they’ve changed less than an arcsecond in all
cases.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>24. Generic zodiac offset:</span> The standard zodiac
offset setting (the optional ayanamsa parameter to the -s switch) is now only
applied when the sidereal zodiac is active. This makes it easier to switch back
and forth between the standard tropical zodiac, and the sidereal zodiac with an
ayanamsa set. There’s a new separate setting which is always applied to all
charts (both tropical and sidereal). It’s set by a new optional parameter to
the -Ys switch. For example, to invert all zodiac positions 180 degrees for charts
in the southern hemisphere, set this parameter to 180 when the chart latitude
is below 0 degrees South.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>25. Hotkey extended:</span> In non-GUI graphics
versions of Astrolog such as X-Windows, pressing the &quot;v&quot; key will display
the standard listing of chart positions in the console (-v switch). Now, if in
relationship comparison mode, it will output the relationship comparison
version of the text listing.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>26. Degree time zones:</span> Time zones may
optionally be specified as a degree value to use instead of hours. Treat this
like a longitude value, but with the prefix “m”. For example “m90e00” means 90
degrees East, which is interpreted the same as “6:00E” for 6 hours East. This
was added to support Astrodatabank files, which sometimes specify time zones in
this manner.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>27. TZ database updated:</span> Astrolog’s time zone
change information has been updated to use TZ database version “2022a” (instead
of “2021a” which was used before). This new version has a few subtle
corrections and improvements to various areas in the world.</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=change>PROGRAM CHANGES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A few changes that aren't new feature additions or bug fixes have been
made to Astrolog 7.40, which means certain old assumptions are no longer valid.
Most can be considered improvements, but they still change existing behavior. A
list of these follows (which aren't useful to be aware of unless you have used
previous versions of the program):</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>1. Lilith glyph changed:</span> Astrolog’s “European”
glyph for Lilith has been modified to have a cross below the backwards facing
crescent, which in current years is the most common form of this glyph. This
glyph has also been made the default, over Astrolog’s “Classic” glyph of a
circle with a slash through it. The classic Lilith glyph is still an option in
the Graphics Settings dialog (-YXf switch). </p>

<p class=A><span class=X>2. Vertex glyph changed:</span> Astrolog’s default
glyph for the Vertex has been changed to a “Vx” abbreviation, which in current
years in the most common form of this glyph. The classic Vertex glyph of a
cross with split ends can still be selected using a new option in the Graphics
Settings dialog (-YXf switch).</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>3. Transit event restrictions moved:</span> In the
Windows version, the transit time event restriction settings (for sign,
direction, latitude, and distance changes) have been moved from the Setting /
Display Settings dialog to the Chart / Transits dialog, which makes them easier
to notice and change when doing transit charts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>4. Previous button renamed:</span> In the Windows
version, the “Previous” button in the Chart Info dialogs has been renamed to “Recall”.
This aligns better with the Animate / Recall Chart Info menu command, and is
better named too since it recalls a particular chart that was set before, which
isn’t necessarily the immediately previous chart that one worked with.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>5. Sidereal offset differentiated:</span> The zodiac
offset / ayanamsa setting (in the Setting / Calculation Settings dialog, as well
as set with the parameter to the -s switch) now only applies when the sidereal
zodiac is on, and doesn’t also apply to tropical zodiac charts. This is more
intuitive and allows one to easily switch between standard tropical charts, and
sidereal zodiac charts with any particular ayanamsa. There’s a new separate
setting (the optional parameter to the -Ys switch) that gets applied to all
charts, and can be used to cover obscure scenarios such as adding 180 degrees
to all charts in the Southern hemisphere.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>6. Monthly offset changed:</span> The -+m and -+y switches
will now add the specified number of calendar months or years to the chart,
instead of exactly 30 or 360 days. That’s more intuitive and useful behavior.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>7. Thicker lines display:</span> When the thicker
lines graphics setting is on, it will no longer apply to text and glyphs drawn
at the smallest scale. At the smallest scale, text and glyphs with thick lines
were hard to read, since their lines were overlapping.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>8. MAC graphics dropped:</span> The #ifdef MAC and
#ifdef MACOLD compile time options have been removed. The old Macintosh
libraries they referenced no longer exist, and were only used for ancient
Macintoshes with non-Intel chips. Modern Macs are effectively Unix boxes, and
Astrolog can be compiled on them using the Unix settings (including with X11
graphics).</p>

<p class=A>Here are bugs or other issues with version 7.30, all of which have
been corrected in 7.40:</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>1. Sidereal nutation inaccuracy:</span> Sidereal zodiac
positions included nutation for house cusps and related objects like the Vertex
and East Point. Normally, nutation (which can cause an offset of up to 18
arcseconds) is only added to tropical zodiac positions.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>2. Wheel chart coloring:</span> In graphic wheel
charts, the short line segment between a planet glyph and the point along the
ring where the planet actually lies is a gray color for retrograde planets.
This coloring wasn’t always applied correctly for single ring wheels.                                                                                                                                         </p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>3. Sector placement inaccuracy:</span> The Gauquelin
sector charts would include house cusp and related objects like the Vertex and
East Point that shouldn’t ever be present (even if unrestricted). House cusps
don’t rise or set like planets do, and therefore don’t have proper timings to
produce Gauquelin sector positions, and so the positions presented were
inaccurate.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>4. Rising and Setting display:</span> Text mode rising
and setting times charts covering more than a day (such as produced by the -Zdm
or -ZdY switches) would label the day of the week incorrectly, and always show
the day of the week for the current chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>5. Rising and Setting sidereal:</span> The graphics
rising and setting chart (-Zd -X switches) would produce inaccurate timings if
the sidereal zodiac were in effect.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>6. Progressed times inaccuracy:</span> Showing exact
times of progressed to natal aspects (-tp switch) would produce somewhat inaccurate
times. This was especially visible when doing progression times for a single
day (-tpd switch) which would always produce times late in the day near
midnight.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>7. Transit influence positions:</span> The transit
influence charts (-D and -T switches) wouldn’t display the positions of each
body in parentheses correctly, for parallel aspects when that setting was on.
These positions will now show the proper vertical position of each body. They
will also now respect the -sd display format switch, allowing positions to be displayed
as decimals.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>8. Calendar year glitch:</span> Showing the graphic
calendar chart for an entire year, with daily aspects included and visible (-Ky
-XA switches) would change the current chart month to December.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>9. Calendar monthless bug:</span> Showing the calendar
chart for a saved chart which has no time or space, would show garbage text for
the month and potentially crash. The same issue would happen for the text mode
wheel chart (-w -X switches) for the chart date in the middle of the wheel.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>10. Calendar parallel aspects display:</span> Showing
the graphic calendar chart with daily aspects included, and the parallel
aspects setting on, would incorrectly mark Sun/Moon (contra)parallel aspects as
New or Full Moons.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>11. Astro-graph omission:</span> Text mode
astrocartography charts wouldn’t include all possible latitude crossings in the
list of parans, and would sometime miss seeing Ascendant/Descendant crossings
near the poles. For any astrocartography chart with a given number of uniquely
positioned objects, with any orientation of its lines there should always be
the same number of crossings total.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>12. Local space display typo:</span> In the graphic
local space chart (-Nl -X switches), zooming in enough to show latitudes to the
nearest minute along the left/right edges would display them as “W/E” instead
of “N/S”.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>13. Local space zoom bug:</span> In the graphic local
space chart (-Nl -X switches), zooming in too much would distort the lines so
they only display at 90 degree angles.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>14. Planetary moons chart limitation:</span> In the
text mode planetary moons chart (-8 switch) the left hand Lead/Close columns
would always show percentages from the geocentric perspective, even if set for
heliocentric or some other central body.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>15. Planetary moons custom limitation:</span> When
customizing an object slot to be a planetary moon computed by a JPL Horizons
Web query (-Yej switch) the resulting object would be computed correctly,
however it wouldn’t be treated as a planetary moon. For example, it wouldn’t
appear in the planetary moons chart, it wouldn’t be automatically colored based
on the planet it orbits, and so on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>16. Telescope glitch:</span> In the graphic telescope
chart (-XZ switch), Uranus’ rings would sometimes be displayed as having a
rotation of greater than 360 degrees. Ring rotations should always be between
-180 and 180 degrees.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>17. Timeless relationship limitation:</span> Charts
with no time or space (such as composite) wouldn’t work right when used as
inputs into other relationship charts, such as composite or synastry.  </p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>18. Progressed and natal limitation:</span> The
progressed and natal comparison chart (-rp switch) would use the normal set of
object restrictions for the progressed planets, instead of the alternate set of
transit restrictions.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>19. Chart sphere limitation:</span> Chart spheres in
relationship comparison modes would only display up to the first four chart
slots, and not include chart slots #5 or #6.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>20. General meaning crash:</span> The list of general
meanings (-HI switch) would crash when star objects were unrestricted.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>21. File import limitation:</span> Astrolog would fail
to parse command lines in files, specifically the very last line in a file, if
those files didn’t end with a CR or LF character.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>22. Compiler error:</span> Compiling Astrolog would
give an error about the function AddTime() not being found, if Astrolog were
compiled with &quot;#ifdef GRAPH&quot; on, and also if all of the interactive
screen graphics options like &quot;#ifdef X11&quot; and &quot;#ifdef WIN&quot; were
off.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=express>ASTROEXPRESSION UPDATES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>AstroExpressions or “Astrolog Expressions” are programmable
customizations that don’t require recompiling the program, and can be
considered an extended form of command switches. AstroExpression functions and
related command switches have been updated in version 7.40. This section can be
ignored if one doesn’t use this feature area.</p>

<p class=A>The following lists all new AstroExpression functions. The name of
each function is listed, followed by the type of its return value and the
expected types of its parameters (if any). Numbers will automatically be
converted to Integer or Real as needed.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>MonL, DayL, YeaL, TimL, DstL, ZonL, LonL, LatL:</span>
Int(Int) or Real(Int): Chart list indexed chart. Like the functions used to
access chart information in specific slots, but returns chart info for the
referenced chart index in the chart list.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ListCnt:</span> Int. List count. Returns the size of
the chart list in memory.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ListCur:</span> Int. List current position. Returns
the index of the most recent chart list entry displayed with the commands on
the “Info / Chart List” submenu.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>List1:</span> Int. List index #1. Returns the index
into the chart list used for chart slot #1 when using any of the -5e switches.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>List2:</span> Int. List index #2. Returns the index
into the chart list used for chart slot #2 when using the -5e3 or -5e4
switches.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>TiltXY:</span> Real(Int, Real). Coordinate
transformation. Tilts the longitude and latitude coordinates referenced by
custom variables Int and Int+1, by Real degrees. Returns the adjusted
longitude. For example, “TiltXY %x Oblique” will translate between ecliptic and
equatorial coordinates (effectively doing the same as the -sr switch) assuming
longitude and latitude are stored in @x and @y.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>=Obj:</span> Int(Int1, Int2, Int3, Int4). Copy object.
Copies the contents of object Int2 in chart slot Int1, to object Int4 in chart
slot Int3. This includes the object’s longitude and latitude position,
horizontal and vertical and distance velocity, and its house position. Returns
the longitude position.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>=Hou:</span> Int(Int1, Int2, Int3, Int4). Copy house
cusp. Copies the contents of house cusp Int2 in chart slot Int1, to cusp Int4
in chart slot Int3. Returns the house cusp longitude.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DCol:</span> Int(Int). Set draw color. Sets the color
to use for the other D-prefix drawing functions, and returns that color.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DDot:</span> Int(IntX, IntY). Draw pixel. Sets a pixel
in the current draw color at a coordinate. Returns the drawing color used.
Functions like this can be called in contexts such as the ~Q2 AstroExpression
to add additional content to a graphics chart after it’s been drawn.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DSpot:</span> Int(IntX, IntY). Draw spot. Sets a small
cluster of five pixels in the current draw color at a coordinate. Returns the
drawing color used.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DLine:</span> Int(IntX1, IntY1, IntX2, IntY2). Draw
line. Draws a line in the current draw color from a start coordinate to an end
coordinate. Returns the drawing color used.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DBox:</span> Int(IntX1, IntY1, IntX2, IntY2). Draw
box. Draws a rectangle outline in the current draw color between two opposite
corner coordinates. Returns the drawing color used.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DBlock:</span> Int(IntX1, IntY1, IntX2, IntY2). Draw
block. Draws a filled in rectangle in the current draw color between two
opposite corner coordinates. Returns the drawing color used.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DCirc:</span> Int(IntX1, IntY1, IntX2, IntY2). Draw
circle. Draws an ellipse outline in the current draw color between two opposite
corner coordinates. Returns the drawing color used.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DDisk:</span> Int(IntX1, IntY1, IntX2, IntY2). Draw
disk. Draws a filled in ellipse in the current draw color between two opposite
corner coordinates. Returns the drawing color used.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>_Ys, _Ys1, _Y8, _Ya, _Yao, _Yoo, _Yb, _YXa, _YXW:</span>
Bool or Int. Program setting. This list of functions queries the Astrolog
setting that’s set with the identically named command switch. There are only a
few exceptions or alternate behaviors: Functions ending with “1” access the
first argument passed to the switch without that digit. Function _Yoo is a
Boolean for the -Yo switch setting, and includes a extra “o” in its name to
avoid a case insensitive name conflict with _YO.</p>

<p class=A>There are several new command switches which allow one to define
AstroExpression “hooks” into areas of chart calculation or display, to modify
or filter their results. All AstroExpression related command switches start
with the tilde (~) character:</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>1. ~7 &lt;string&gt;:</span> Notify Ray chart. This is
called when the esoteric chart is being interpreted (-7 -I switches) and allows
tracking Ray charts. On entry, @v through @z contain the top percentage Rays
for physical, astral, mental, personality, and soul. Return value is ignored.
For example, to track the count of each possible personality Ray in custom
variables @a through @g, do: <span class=Y>~7 &quot;</span> <span class=Y>=u %y
= Var @u Inc Var Var @u&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>2. ~Zd &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter rising and
setting times. On entry, @x is the planet, @y is the event (0=rises, 1=zeniths,
2=sets, 3=nadirs), and @z is the azimuth in degrees (0 = due East, 90 = due
North). Return value is whether to display the event. For example, to only show
rising events within 10 degrees of due East, do: <span class=Y>~Zd &quot;And
Equ @y 0 Lt LonDist @z 0.0 10.0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>3. ~5s &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust chart list custom
sort order. This is called when the -5s switch is invoked. For each chart in
the chart list, the chart will be cast, and then the AstroExpression called. On
entry, @z is the current chart’s index within the chart list. The return value
is the weight to give this chart, to be used when sorting. (After all charts
have been given weights, the chart list will be sorted from lowest to highest
weight.) For example, to sort by Sun/Moon angle (which will place New Moon
charts first in the list and Full Moon charts last) do: <span class=Y>~5s
&quot;LonDist ObjLon O_Sun ObjLon O_Moo&quot; -5s</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>4. ~5f &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust chart list custom
filter. This is called when the -5f switch is invoked (and also in the Windows
version in the Chart List dialog when the “Filter” button is pressed). For each
chart in the chart list, the chart will be cast, and then the AstroExpression
called. On entry, @z is the current chart’s index within the chart list. The
return value is whether to keep the chart in the list (in which zero means
delete). For example, to only show charts from the chart list which have the
“Moon in the 7th house and Jupiter aligned [Conjunct] with Mars”, do: <span
class=Y>~5f &quot;And Equ ObjHouse O_Moo 7 Equ AspLon O_Jup O_Mar -1 A_Con&quot;
-5f &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>5. ~5Y &lt;string&gt;:</span> Notify chart list enumeration.
This is called when the -Y5 switch is invoked. For each chart or chart pair in
the chart list, the chart(s) will be cast, and then the AstroExpression called.
On entry, no custom variables are set, and return value is ignored too. However
AstroExpression variables List1 (and List2) will be the index of the current
chart(s) being considered. For example, to check which chart in the chart list
forms the most Trine aspects to a natal chart (i.e. to transfer that chart to
slot #2), first load the natal chart in slot #1, then do: <span class=Y>~5Y
&quot;DoGrid2 =c 0 For %i 0 Objs If ObjOn @i For %j 0 Objs If ObjOn @j Do =e
GridNam @i @j If Equ @e A_Tri =c Inc @c If Gt @c @d Do =d @c =a List1&quot; ~1
&quot;=d 0&quot; -5Y2 -qL2 ~@a</span></p>
