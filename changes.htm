<p class=FA>                         **  VERSION 7.70  **</p>

<p class=FA>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=A>Release notes for Astrolog version 7.70 (April 2024):</p>

<p class=A>This file describes the freeware astrology software program Astrolog
version 7.70 and the additions and fixes made to it, over the previous version 7.60
which was released a year ago in April 2023. The main thing in this update is exoplanets.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=feature>NEW FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are new additions to version 7.70 that weren't in previous
versions:</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>1. Exoplanets:</span> Astrolog has the ability to show
exoplanets, or planets that orbit other stars. The strongest event in astrology
is the eclipse or two bodies overlapping, and Astrolog can already detect when planets
and moons eclipse each other. Detecting when exoplanets pass in front of their
stars is a natural next step for astrology, in which exoplanet transits
accentuate that fixed star’s energy. Here are various features that work with
exoplanets:</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Exoplanets chart:</span> Astrolog has a new exoplanets
chart, which can be displayed with the -Ux switch, or “Setting / Planetary
Moons / Exoplanets Chart” menu command in the Windows version. It will show text
listing exoplanet transits taking place at or around the chart time. In this
chart, for each exoplanet transit its name and zodiac position location will be
displayed, along with the magnitude of the star. The date/time of the transit
event will be displayed as well, as a series of five values: When it might
start, when it definitely starts, the middle of the transit, when it might end,
and when it’s definitely ended. This text is colored red for when the “definitely
no” period ends and the “maybe” period starts, yellow for when the “maybe”
period ends and the “definitely yes” period starts, and green for the middle of
the “definitely yes” period. If one of the times takes place after midnight on
the next day, it will be instead colored white. Finally displayed is the
duration of the transit, and the current uncertainty offset of it (which is
always half the span of the yellow “maybe” periods).</p>

<p class=B>Exoplanets don’t have known orbital elements, like planets and moons
do. Exoplanets are instead detected by means such as dimming of the star they
pass in front of. This means things such as Earth’s position in its orbit
around the Sun may slightly affect when exoplanet transits actually take place.
As a result, exoplanets transits are defined by a period and duration, combined
with uncertainty offsets for both of them. These uncertainties increase the greater
number of iterations a transit is from when it was originally observed.
Eventually (far enough in the past or future) the yellow “maybe” periods on the
sides get wide enough such that the green “definitely yes” period in the middle
disappears. In such a case only three times will be displayed: When the “maybe”
period starts and ends, and the middle of it displayed in yellow. If the 3D
houses setting is off (-c3 switch) then only transits with a “definitely yes”
period will be included in the list.</p>

<p class=B>The exoplanets chart by default displays those exoplanets in effect
during the chart time. If the Parallel Aspects setting is on, then it will
instead search over a period of time and display all exoplanet transits that
take place during it. The period of time is taken from the “times and graph
cover” transit settings, and may be a day, month, year, or range of years. On
the command line, the switch may be invoked as -Uxd, -Uxm, -Uxy, or -UxY to
select a day, month, year, or five years. (The -EY switch setting can select a
different range of years.) Also, the -ma switch setting affects the exoplanets
chart, and if enabled each exoplanet transit will have listed after it the
aspects it makes to planets in the main chart.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Exoplanet graphics:</span> Exoplanets can be plotted
in Astrolog graphic charts, including the local horizon, chart sphere, and
globe charts. The new -XUx command switch, or the “Graphics / Map Effects /
Show Exoplanets” menu command in the Windows version, will show them. Exoplanets
won’t be shown if there’s no transit happening, they will be displayed in
yellow if they might be happening, and they’ll be displayed in green if a
transit is definitely happening. Note that exoplanets are still in the process
of being discovered, and sky searches for them tend to focus on some areas more
than others. For example, the default list of exoplanets has more of a presence
in tropical Aquarius (or more specifically near the boundary between the
constellations Cygnus and Lyra) than other signs.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Filter exoplanets:</span> The exoplanets chart can be
filtered to only display those exoplanets that are in a specified list. The new
-YUx switch takes a comma separated list of exoplanet names, and indicates the
exoplanet(s) to display. This is most useful when displaying an exoplanets
search over a period of time, and you want to focus upon the various transits a
select exoplanet makes.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Exoplanet file:</span> The list of exoplanets is
stored in the comma separated value (CSV) file astexopl.csv. In the Windows
version, the new “Help / Open Data Files / Open Exoplanet List” menu command
will open this file in Notepad. The default file is from the NASA Exoplanet Archive,
and lists 4190 exoplanets. That’s more than the 1100 stars in Astrolog’s fixed
star list sefstars.txt, however note many of the exoplanets are orbiting rather
dim stars. Additional exoplanet lists can be downloaded from: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/exo">http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/exo</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=V>2. Progressed rings:</span> Astrolog multiwheels can
individually turn on progressions for specific rings, which will make that ring
be the chart in ring #1 progressed to the time in that ring. The new -rP switch
takes a parameter indicating the ring to be progressed. In the Windows version,
the “Charts #3 Through #6” command dialog has new checkboxes to turn on
progression for wheels #2 through #5. This feature allows one to easily display
multiwheel scenarios such as natal, transits, and progressions together.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>3. Natural Lilith:</span> The new -Ynn switch will
make Astrolog’s Black Moon Lilith object be natural Lilith. The natural Lilith
is a calculation which interpolates and also considers the gravitational pull
of the Sun (i.e. that the Moon’s orbit is more than just a simple ellipse), and
so may potentially be considered more accurate than the more common mean or
true/osculating Lilith calculation methods. When active, this will override the
-Yn switch setting that selects either mean or true/osculating Lilith.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>4. Transit time zone:</span> In the Windows version,
the Transits dialog has fields for the Daylight Time and Time Zone fields, in
the Transit to Natal Info section. This makes it clearer what time zone transit
to natal charts are using when those charts are displayed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>5. Rainbow colorings:</span> In the Windows version,
in the Graphics Settings dialog, the “Wheel Fill” section has a new “Rainbow2”
option. This will do a rainbow color fill of wheel charts based on RYB paint
colors, such that Aries is red, Leo is yellow, and Sagittarius is blue. This is
in contrast to the old “Rainbow1” option, which does a rainbow fill based on
RGB light colors, such that Aries is red, Leo is green, and Sagittarius is
blue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=V>6. Disable text:</span> The new -Y0 switch
will disable all chart text output. This can be used in scenarios when
computing charts in sequence, in which the earlier charts don’t need to be
displayed. For example, to display a true solar arc progression based on the
Sun’s slightly variable motion per day, it requires casting multiple charts to
calculate the natal and secondary progressed chart, and then doing a solar arc
progressed chart with the exact offset of the secondary progressed Sun (so the
secondary and solar arc progressed Suns will always be exactly the same). To do
this and only display the final solar arc chart, do: astrolog -Yq3 &quot;-i
mychart.as =b0 =Y0&quot; &quot;~1 '=a ObjLon O_Sun' =pn&quot; &quot;~1 '=b
ObjLon O_Sun' =p0n ~p0 '=z Sub @b @a' _Y0&quot;</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>7. Default chart identity:</span> The default set of
chart info as set in the “Default Chart Info” command can now be accessed in a
similar manner as other charts. The -qD and -iD subswitches will set or load a
file into the default chart info. The virtual file “__d” can be used to
represent the default chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>8. Interpretation insertion:</span> The new -YYI
switch is designed to only be invoked from a macro called within one of the new
~I switch AstroExpression hooks. It takes one string parameter to add to the
interpretation text output.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>9. Daedalus output:</span> The new -ox switch will
output Astrolog’s star positions to a Daedalus script file compatible with
Daedalus 3.4 or later. This output will include the list of extra stars (-XU
switch), the list of asteroids if enabled (-XE switch), and the list of exoplanets
if enabled (-XUx switch).</p>

<p class=A>-</p>

<p class=A>Here's a summary of the 16 new command switches in Astrolog 7.70
that weren't in previous versions:</p>

<p class=N><span class=Z>-Ux:</span> Display exoplanets chart listing exact

<p class=Section><a name=extend>EXTENDED AND IMPROVED FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A list of improvements to existing features in Astrolog 7.70, such
as new things you can now do with old features that you couldn’t do before, or
ways that existing features work better than before:</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>1. Ray decorations:</span> Astrolog can display the
dominant Ray(s) of a chart in the upper left corner of a wheel chart. The -YXv
switch has been extended to accept three more values. In the Windows version,
the new “Wheel Corners” dropdown in Graphics Settings is populated with these
three Ray related decorations. The three new options are:</p>

<p class=B>“-YXv 3” switch or “Rays 1” dropdown option: The strongest Ray as shown
in the -7 switch chart will be displayed in the upper left corner.</p>

<p class=B>“-YXv 4” switch or “Rays 1.2” dropdown option: The strongest two
Rays as shown in the -7 switch chart will be displayed in the upper left
corner. For example, if the strongest Ray is 4 and the second strongest 5, it will
be displayed as “Ray 4.5”.</p>

<p class=B>“-YXv 5” switch or “Rays 12345” dropdown option: The five top Rays
for soul, personality, mental, astral, and physical as shown in the -7 switch
interpretation will be displayed in the upper left corner.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>2. Rings of Quaoar:</span> The telescope chart (-XZ
switch) will display the newly discovered rings of Quaoar when zoomed in enough
upon this body.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>3. Transit ephemeris:</span> The graphic ephemeris in
transit and natal comparison mode (-E -X -rt switches) will now look at transit
restrictions separately, and use them to determine which transiting planets to
include in the ephemeris.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>4. Local horizon flipping:</span> The placement of
directions in the circular local horizon chart (-Z0 -X switches) can be changed
with the -YZ switch setting. If the -YZ switch setting is odd, the chart will
be flipped horizontally across the East West axis (and the E/W labels will be
flipped too of course). If the -YZ setting is 4 or greater, the chart will be
flipped vertically across the North South axis.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>5. More macros:</span> Command switch macros as
defined with the -M0 switch can be of any number now. Users are no longer
limited to slots 1-48.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>6. TZ database updated:</span> Astrolog’s time zone
change information has been updated to use TZ database version “2024a” (instead
of “2023b” which was used before). This new version has a few subtle
corrections and improvements to various areas in the world.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>7. Compilation dependency:</span> Compiling the
Windows version is no longer dependent upon the Microsoft Foundation Classes
(MFC) file afxres.h. This allows Astrolog to be compiled without having to have
the large MFC area installed.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=change>PROGRAM CHANGES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A few changes that aren't new feature additions or bug fixes have
been made to Astrolog 7.70, which means certain old assumptions are no longer
valid. Most can be considered improvements, but they still change existing
behavior. A list of these follows (which aren't useful to be aware of unless
you have used previous versions of the program):</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>1. Tri-wheels reversed:</span> Astrolog’s graphic
tri-wheels and larger now have rings arranged from the inside out (with chart
#1 on the inside), instead of the reverse. This makes tri-wheels and such
behave like bi-wheels (which also have chart #1 on the inside).</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>2. Rulerships changed:</span> Rulerships and
exaltations have been assigned to the seven Dwarf planet objects. Default
rulerships and exaltations have been changed for some of the four first
asteroids, to be more in alignment with the most common signs used for them.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>3. Progression time:</span> For progressed charts, the
text mode wheel chart (-w switch) will now display the progressed date/time in
the middle of the wheel. This will be displayed instead of the chart’s Universal
Time and sidereal time.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>4. Ephem subdirectory:</span> Downloads of Astrolog
now place all ephemeris files in the “ephem” subdirectory.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=bug>BUG FIXES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are bugs or other issues with version 7.60, all of which have
been fixed in 7.70:</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>1. Time inaccuracy:</span> In the text mode wheel
chart (-w switch) the Universal Time (UT) label of the chart wouldn’t be
displayed accurately for charts whose time zone is LMT or LAT.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>2. Transit crash:</span> Accessing the “recall” chart
(such as with “-i set” on the command line) after displaying a transit to
transit times chart or a transit to natal times chart (-d or -t switches) would
crash, due to the “recall” chart being initialized with bad name and location
fields.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>3. Progressed ephemeris bug:</span> Displaying a
graphic ephemeris chart (-E -X switches) with progressions turned on wouldn’t
display or animate correctly.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>4. Progressed text display:</span> In the text mode
standard listing (-v _X switches) with progressions turned on, the day of week
of the progressed date would be incorrect (and would be the same as the natal
day of the week).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>5. Progressed and natal display:</span> Displaying the
progressed and natal bi-wheel chart (-rp switch) would list progressed planets
in the sidebar based on natal restrictions, instead of the transit
restrictions. Also, the aspects in the middle would only involve planets in the
progressed wheel if they were also unrestricted in the natal wheel. Also,
planets in the progressed wheel that were restricted in the natal wheel would
be displayed at 0Aries.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>6. Relative path limitation:</span> Specifying
relative file paths in the -Yi switches wouldn’t find the Swiss Ephemeris
format ephemeris files. Now all files can be located with relative file paths,
which means a definition like “-Yi ephem” will point to the “ephem”
subdirectory off of the Astrolog install directory containing the executable.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>7. Orbit trail crash:</span> Increasing the value of
the solar system orbit trail length field in the Graphics Settings dialog (-YXj
switch) would crash the next time the graphic solar system orbit chart was
generated.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>8. Star color bug:</span> Customizing the colors of stars
and asteroids with the -YkU and -YkE switches would only affect the last star or
asteroid in the specified list.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>9. Windows glitch:</span> In the Windows version,
opening an Astrolog chart file by double clicking it would clobber the data in
chart slot #2.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>10. Wireframe sphere display:</span> A wireframe file
created of the chart sphere would position the astronomical constellations
wrongly. (The constellations would rotate in reverse direction as the chart
sphere was rotated.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>11. PostScript display:</span> PostScript charts
wouldn’t always be scaled correctly on the page, in which non-default chart or
page sizes would result in tiny charts or charts clipped by the page edges.
PostScript charts are now scaled in the middle of the page appropriately, for
both portrait and landscape.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>12. PostScript fonts:</span> The font Consolas
couldn’t be selected for PostScript text, and attempting to do so would result
in text in a variable width font which would look bad.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>13. Metafile display:</span> In Windows metafile
output, the vertical line between the wheel chart and the sidebar would be
missing, if lines were being drawn in the standard “non-thick” mode (-Xx switch
not set).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>14. File limitation:</span> In command line versions
of Astrolog, the -i switch would always result in the program thinking chart
information was specified, even if the file only contained settings. That would
result in the program no longer prompting the user to enter chart information,
and displaying a default chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>15. X11 window bug:</span> In the X11 Windows version,
pressing enter to specify a command line, would spawn a new window afterward
(leaving the old window still present but abandoned).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>16. Solar arc transit limitation:</span> On the
command line, the switches -dp0y wouldn’t work to set a solar arc progressed to
natal scan over the year, even though -dp0 and -dpy would both work separately
to set either solar arc progressed to natal, or progressions scanning over a
year.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>17. Switch error handling:</span> On the command line,
passing an out of range value to the -z, -z0, or -zl switches would correctly
show an error message, however would still keep the bad data in the setting
afterward, which would cause problems if a chart was then displayed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>18. String appending limitation:</span> An obscure
feature allows one to include extra strings after the filename of the -o
switch, and have them appended as comments to the file. This feature would only
work when -o was invoked from the operating system shell.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=express>ASTROEXPRESSION UPDATES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>AstroExpressions or “Astrolog Expressions” are programmable
customizations that don’t require recompiling the program, and can be
considered an extended form of command switches. AstroExpression functions and
related command switches have been updated in version 7.70. This section can be
ignored if one doesn’t use this feature area.</p>

<p class=A>The following lists all new AstroExpression functions. The name of
each function is listed, followed by the type of its return value and the
expected types of its parameters (if any). Numbers will automatically be
converted to Integer or Real as needed.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Bool:</span> Bool(Num). Boolean. Converts a number to boolean.
Like the “(bool)” cast operator in C.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>&amp;&amp;:</span> Bool(Int, Int). Logical And.
Returns whether two numbers are both non-zero. This function does not do short
circuit evaluation, meaning both arguments are always evaluated even if the
first is false. Like the “&amp;&amp;” operator in C.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>||:</span> Bool(Int, Int). Logical Or. Returns whether
at least one of two numbers is non-zero. This function does not do short
circuit evaluation, meaning both arguments are always evaluated even if the
first is true. Like the “||” operator in C.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Dist3:</span> Real(Real, Real, Real). 3D distance. Returns
the distance from the origin to a triplicity of real coordinates.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Off:</span> Real. Time zone offset. Returns the offset
in hours from UTC of the current chart. This is normally (Tim - Dst) except
also handle the case if time zone is Local Mean Time (LMT) or Daylight is
Autodetect. There are similar functions for chart slots #1 through #6.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjLen:</span> Real(Int). Object distance. Return the
distance from the central object to the specified object, in AU. There are
similar functions for chart slots #1 through #6.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>AspOn:</span> Bool(Int). Aspect on. Returns whether an
aspect is present and not restricted. Specified with -RA switch.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>JulianD:</span> Real(IntM, IntD, IntY, RealT): Julian
Day. Returns the Julian day for the given month, day, year, and time in hours
(relative to UTC/GMT).</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Alloc:</span> Int. Allocations. Returns the number of
memory allocations currently existing in the program.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>AllocTot:</span> Int. Total allocations. Returns the
total number of memory allocations ever made by the program since it started.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>AllocSiz:</span> Int. Total allocations size. Returns
the total size in bytes of all memory allocations ever made by the program
since it started.</p>

<p class=A>There are several new command switches which allow one to define
AstroExpression “hooks” into areas of chart calculation or display, to modify
or filter their results. All AstroExpression related command switches start
with the tilde (~) character:</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>1. ~Ux &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter exoplanet
details. Called each time an exoplanet transit is about to be displayed in the
-Ux switch chart. On entry, @w is the star’s brightness or magnitude, @x is the
period between transits in hours, @y is the duration of the transit in hours,
and @z is the Julian Day of the current transit. Return value is whether to
display the transit. For example, to only display exoplanets transiting stars
brighter than magnitude 10, do: <span class=Y>~Ux &quot;Lt @w 10.0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>2. ~FN &lt;string&gt;:</span> Font adjustment for Nakshatra.
Called each time a real font character is displayed for a Nakshatra, and allows
customizing it. On entry, @u is Astrolog’s index for the Nakshatra being drawn,
@v is the font character (usually between 32-127 for low Ascii), @w is the font
index (6=Courier, 7=Consolas, 8=Arial, 9=Nakshatra), @x and @y are the pixel
coordinates where the glyph will be drawn (which can be adjusted to move glyphs
that seem off-center), and @z is the relative scale percentage (which can be
adjusted for glyphs that seem too large or too small). Return value is ignored,
although if any of @v through @z are modified they will be used to draw the glyph
instead.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>3. ~sd &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust degree. Called
each time a zodiac position number from 0-360 is about to be displayed in the
-sd switch display mode. On entry, @z is the number about to be displayed. The
return value is the number to use instead. For example, to have an alternate
display mode where the zodiac is divided into 100 degrees instead of 360, do: <span
class=Y>~sd &quot;Div Mul @z 100 360&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>4. ~Iv &lt;string&gt;:</span> Pre-notify location
interpretation. This is called when interpretation text for a planet position
is about to be displayed. The -YYI switch can be called to prepend additional
interpretation text. On entry, @z is the planet being interpreted. Return value
is whether to then still display Astrolog’s default interpretation text for the
location.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>5. ~IV &lt;string&gt;:</span> Post-notify location
interpretation. This is called when interpretation text for a planet position
has just been displayed. The -YYI switch can be called to append additional
interpretation text. On entry, @z is the planet being interpreted. Return value
is ignored. For example, to add clarifying text about Ceres to interpretations
involving it, do: <span class=Y>~IV &quot;If Equ @z O_Cer Switch 1&quot; -M0 1
&quot;-YYI 'Ceres is the only Dwarf planet in the asteroid belt.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>6. ~Ia &lt;string&gt;:</span> Pre-notify aspect
interpretation. This is called when interpretation text for an aspect is about
to be displayed. On entry, @x and @z are the two planets forming the aspect,
and @y is the aspect. Return value is whether to still display Astrolog’s
default interpretation text for the aspect.</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>7. ~IA &lt;string&gt;:</span> Post-notify aspect
interpretation. This is called when interpretation text for an aspect has just
been displayed. On entry, @x and @z are the two planets forming the aspect, and
@y is the aspect. Return value is ignored. For example, to add emphasis text
about Squares to interpretations involving them, do: <span class=Y>~IA &quot;If
Equ @y A_Squ Switch 1&quot; -M0 1 &quot;-YYI 'This is the most challenging
aspect!'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=A>A few improvements or bug fixes have also been made in the
AstroExpression area:</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>More macros:</span> AstroExpression macros can be of
any number now. Users are no longer limited to slots 0-26.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>ObjXN bug:</span> The ObjXN, ObjYN, and ObjZN
functions didn’t work, for starters because they only parsed one argument when
they actually take two.</p>
