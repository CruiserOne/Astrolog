<p class=FA>                         **  VERSION 7.80  **</p>

<p class=FA>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=A>Release notes for Astrolog version 7.80 (June 2025):</p>

<p class=A>Happy Solstice and start of Cancer everyone! :) This file describes
the freeware astrology software program Astrolog version 7.80 and the additions
and fixes made to it, over the previous version 7.70 which was released 14
months ago in April 2024. The main things in this update are antialiasing,
constellation lines, and wheel chart degrees.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=feature>NEW FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are new additions to version 7.80 that weren't in previous
versions:</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>1. Antialiasing:</span> Astrolog now supports
antialiasing when drawing graphics. That means lines drawn aren’t blocky with
pixels being either fully on or off, but rather the edges can blur with their
surroundings, which looks smoother. To antialias charts, select the Graphics /
Chart Effects / Antialias Lines menu command, or use the new -Xx0 switch.
Antialiasing is supported when generating Windows bitmaps, and on the Windows
screen. It’s not supported in PostScript or metafiles (which are vector formats
so don’t have pixelation), or in X Windows. System fonts on the Windows screen
are already antialiased, but this will affect text and glyphs drawn in
Astrolog’s internal fonts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>2. Constellation lines:</span> Astrolog’s displays which
can show astronomical constellation boundaries can now also include lines
between stars that form the constellations. To display constellation lines,
select the Graphics / Map Effects / Show Constellation Lines menu command, or
use the new -YXU1 switch. This is an extension to the feature which displays
all stars, so requires that setting (-XU switch) to be enabled first.</p>

<p class=B>To implement constellation lines, the program internally applies a
set of -YXU switches to define which stars have lines between them.
Constellation lines can be shown in old versions 7.20 and beyond by loading the
following command file into the program (which contains the same set of -YXU
switches that are now embedded within the program): <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/script/constel.as">http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/script/constel.as</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=V>3. Constellation lookup:</span> Astrolog has an option
to list which planets are in which astronomical constellations. To show
constellations, set the Wheel Sign Subdivision Type dropdown to the new value
“Constellation”, or pass the value 10 to the -v3 command switch. The standard
text mode list of planets (-v _X switches) will include in the rightmost column
which constellation the object lies within. This constellation may be any of
the 88 total, and not just the 13 constellations along the ecliptic. Note the print
nearest second setting (-b0 switch) needs to be on in order to show this
column.</p>

<p class=B>This setting will also apply to the graphics wheel chart, and will
subdivide the signs into the 13 astronomical constellations that lie along the
ecliptic (which are the 12 zodiac constellations plus Ophiuchus). In other
words, this shows an irregularly sized “13 sign zodiac”. Because the wheel is
two dimensional, it can only mark the constellations that are along the
ecliptic, as if the planets were located at 0 latitude, when planets may actually
be located in any of the 88 constellations which are above or below the
ecliptic.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>4. Stationary indication:</span> Astrolog can display
when a planet is stationary, which means its velocity is near zero, and it’s
about to switch direction. Normally planets are considered either retrograde or
direct, and displayed with an “R” or nothing. The new -Yw switch setting
indicates the velocity value below which a planet will be considered
stationary, which means it will be displayed with an “S” in charts. This
setting tends to work better if the velocities relative to average speed
setting (-v0 switch) is on, to avoid slow moving outer planets being stationary
for longer periods of time. For example, -Yw 0.01 means a planet will be
stationary if its velocity is less than 0.01 degrees per day, or if its
velocity is less than 0.01 or 1% of its average speed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>5. Millisecond display:</span> Astrolog can display
planet positions, times, and longitude and latitude locations to the
millisecond. Turn this on with the -b1 command switch. It modifies the print
nearest second setting (-b0 switch), and causes it when on to display to the
nearest millisecond instead of the nearest second.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>6. Swap charts:</span> The new -ix switch will swap the
contents of chart slots #1 and #2. In the Windows version, use the new Info /
Chart List / Swap Chart #1 and #2 menu command, or the Ctrl+Shift+X hotkey.
Swapping the charts in an easy manner is useful in scenarios such as synastry
charts, when determining which chart controls the planets versus which controls
the houses.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>7. Recall restrictions:</span> In the Windows version,
the Restrictions dialogs contain a new “Recall” button, which will restore
object restrictions to the defaults that were loaded on program startup (or to
the last time the restriction status was saved internally with the -YRo
switch).</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>8. Combined zone offset:</span> The new -Yz1 switch
will display overall time zone offsets in the program as a single value, such
as “h4w” for Eastern Daylight Time (5 hours West of UTC with Daylight Time on,
so total offset is 4 hours West). Normally the program displays Daylight Time
status separate from time zone, so for example Eastern Daylight Time is “DT
Zone 5W”, and Eastern Standard Time is “ST Zone 5W”.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>9. Animate fraction:</span> The -Xn switch has been
extended to accept the values 11-13 to step by 1/10th of a second, 1/100th of a
second, or 1/1000th of a second at a time. In the Windows version, these can be
selected by new menu commands on the Jump Rate submenu. This works best when
the millisecond display setting (-b1 switch) is active, so one can actually see
the time adjust by fractions of a second.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>10. Scribble color:</span> The new -Xk switch will set
the scribble color to use when drawing on the window with the left mouse
button. This can be set with menu options in the Windows version, but it’s nice
to have a method to use in other environments too.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>11. Set orb type:</span> The new -gs switch (and the
-as switch which does the same thing) takes a parameter between 0-2, and will
set the orb type to either positive/negative, applying/separating, or
waxing/waning. This can already be set with the -gp and -gx subswitches, but
it’s nice to have a separate way of setting it without having to turn on the -g
or -a switch charts at the same time.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>12. Set sidebar:</span> The new -Xv0 switch sets
whether graphic wheel charts are displayed with a sidebar showing chart
information and positions. This used to be controlled by the -v0 switch setting
which is also used for planet velocities, in which it should really be
determined by its own separate setting.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>13. Change text scale:</span> In the Windows version,
the new menu commands Graphics / Character Scale / Decrease Text and Increase
Text will decrement or increment the graphics text scale in steps between 100% and
400%. This can already be set within the Graphics Settings dialog, but it’s
nice to be able to change the setting faster with the menu’s Ctrl+&lt; and Ctrl+&gt;
hotkeys.</p>

<p class=A>-</p>

<p class=A>Here's a summary of the 9 new command switches in Astrolog 7.80 that
weren't in previous versions:</p>

<p class=N><span class=Z>-gs &lt;0-2&gt;:</span> Like -g but set orbs to
offset, app/sep, or wax/wan.</p>

<p class=N><span class=Z>-ix:</span> Swap contents of chart #1 and chart #2.</p>

<p class=N><span class=Z>-b1:</span> Display locations/times to nearest
millisecond instead.</p>

<p class=N><span class=Z>-Yw &lt;num&gt;:</span> Set velocity for planets to be
considered stationary.</p>

<p class=N><span class=Z>-Yz1:</span> Display single time offset combining
Daylight and time zone.</p>

<p class=N><span class=Z>-YXU1:</span> Set lines to depict all 88 astronomical
constellations.</p>

<p class=N><span class=Z>-Xx0:</span> Draw antialiased lines in graphics
charts.</p>

<p class=N><span class=Z>-Xv0:</span> Display sidebar to the right side of
wheel charts.</p>

<p class=N><span class=Z>-Xk &lt;col&gt;:</span> Set current pen scribble
color.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=extend>EXTENDED AND IMPROVED FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A list of improvements to existing features in Astrolog 7.80, such
as new things you can now do with old features that you couldn’t do before, or
ways that existing features work better than before:</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>1. Degree wheels:</span> Graphic wheel charts now have
the option to display degree numbers next to each planet on the wheel. This
will include degrees and minutes, and retrogradation status. Normally this
information is only available in the sidebar. This setting is controlled by the
Show Cities option (-XL switch), and in the Windows version can be toggled with
the new “Show Degrees on Wheel” menu option when right mouse clicking. The
degree number option applies to single wheels and bi-wheels, but not tri-wheels
and beyond.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>2. Local astrocartography:</span> Astrolog’s graphic
local space chart (-Nl -X switches) can now also do astrocartography. If the
globe halves focus on southern hemisphere setting is active (the “0” part of the
-XG0 switch) then the lines drawn will be astrocartography instead of local
space. In the Windows version, this can be toggled with the “Lines are
Astro-Graph” menu option when right mouse clicking. Astrolog’s astro-graph and
maps charts can show astrocartography for the entire world, but it’s nice to
have an ability to zoom in on a particular region to see how lines relate to
cities and such.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>3. Zodiacal astrocartography:</span> Astrolog’s text
and graphics charts which display astrocartography (its astro-graph, world map,
and local space charts) now have an option to do zodiacal positioning. Zodiacal
means lines are based on a planet’s zodiac position only, and ignore ecliptic latitude
and assume latitude is zero. The 3D houses setting (-c3 switch) controls this,
and in the Windows version can be toggled with the “Ignore Planet Latitudes”
menu option when right mouse clicking.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>4. Eclipse areas:</span> Astrolog’s graphic globe and
local space charts will darken the parts of the world that are night, when the
world map in Mollewide projection setting (the “0” part of the -XW0 switch) is
on. If eclipse detection is also on (-Yu switch) and a solar eclipse is taking
place, then the parts of the world actually seeing the eclipse will now be
darkened too. Any part of the world experiencing totality or annularity will be
highlighted in red. An image of this feature showing an eclipse progressing can
be seen at: <a href="https://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/eclipseg.gif">https://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/eclipseg.gif</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=W>5. Wheel eclipse glyphs:</span> Many Astrolog charts
will display a Conjunction or Opposition aspect that’s also an eclipse with
glyphs that have the circle(s) filled in. (This assumes that eclipse detection
is on, and that the current aspect font contains such glyphs.) This now also
happens for the standard wheel charts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>6. Midpoint aspects comparison:</span> The setting to
display aspects to each midpoint in the text mode midpoint chart (-ma switch)
now also works for the relationship comparison version of the chart (-r0 -m
switches). This will display aspects from midpoints between the two charts,
made to planets in the second chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>7. Extra stars charts:</span> The list of extra stars
or extra asteroids (-XU or -XE switches) will be displayed in more charts,
specifically the text mode standard list (-v _X switches) and text mode local
horizon chart (-Z _X).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>8. Sort extra stars:</span> The list of extra stars or
extra asteroids (-XU or -XE switches) when displayed in text mode charts will
now be sorted by the star sorting setting (-U switch parameter). All sorting
options are available except by distance, and sorting by brightness is only
available for stars.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>9. Minute ephemeris:</span> The text mode ephemeris
chart which displays positions at a specified interval can now also do minute
intervals, with the “n” parameter to the -E0 switch. For example, -E0 n5 will
display ephemeris positions every five minutes.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>10. Natural perigee option:</span> The natural node
setting (-Ynn switch) will now affect custom objects set to the Moon perigee
point. For example, the switch -YeOp &lt;slot&gt; Moo will calculate the
natural perigee of the Moon, just like the -Ynn switch setting will make the
Lilith object be the natural apogee of the Moon (instead of the mean/true
apogee).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>11. Text mode fonts:</span> In the Windows version,
the text font field in Graphics Settings will now also affect text mode charts.
This makes the Courier New and Consolas fonts available as options. The
“Astrolog” font option will produce the existing behavior of using the system
Terminal font. The thicker lines setting (-Xx switch) if active will affect
these alternative fonts, and display them in boldface.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>12. Unicode fallback:</span> Astrolog’s internal text
font displayed in graphics charts is in the Latin-1 codepage containing 256
characters. Characters that aren’t one of these are usually displayed as “?”
characters. This situation will now attempt to find an Ascii fallback character
if possible, by removing the accent or diacritical mark from letters, before
displaying as “?”.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>13. Longer command lines:</span> Command lines in
Astrolog switch files used to be limited to 1020 characters long, with later
characters truncated. Now they can be any length or number of characters.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>14. TZ database updated:</span> Astrolog’s time zone
change information has been updated to use TZ database version “2025b” (instead
of “2024a” which was used before). This new version has a few subtle
corrections and improvements to various areas in the world.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>15. Exoplanet list updated:</span> Astrolog’s default
list of exoplanets has been updated, expanding from 4190 to 4401 exoplanets.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=change>PROGRAM CHANGES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A few changes that aren't new feature additions or bug fixes have
been made to Astrolog 7.80, which means certain old assumptions are no longer
valid. Most can be considered improvements, but they still change existing
behavior. A list of these follows (which aren't useful to be aware of unless
you have used previous versions of the program):</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>1. Part of Fortune changed:</span> The Part of Fortune
object (along with other parts in the Arabic parts chart) have changed how
night charts are determined. Before this was defined by the Sun being in houses
1-6, which isn’t the best for non-quadrant systems. Now a night chart means the
Sun is less than 180 degrees after the position of the Ascendant. If the 3D
houses setting is on (-c3 switch) then night charts will be based on if the
Sun’s actual local horizon position is below the horizon, which may take atmospheric
refraction into account (if the -Yf switch setting is on).</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>2. Sidebar setting changed:</span> Whether graphic
wheel charts are displayed with a sidebar showing chart information and
positions, is now controlled by the new -Xv0 switch. This used to be controlled
by the -v0 switch setting used for planet velocities, in which it should really
be determined by its own separate setting.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>3. Sign change display:</span> In the text mode
transit times charts (-d and -t switches) when a planet changes sign it’s
displayed with an arrow like “--&gt;”. Now, if the planet is retrograde, the
sign change will be displayed with a backwards arrow like “&lt;--“. This is
consistent with transits displayed in the graphics calendar chart, which also
has both types of arrow.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>4. Allow empty chart list:</span> Saving a chart list
to Astrolog’s chart list format will now allow an empty zero size list to be
written. Before, if the chart list was empty, a length one list containing the
main chart slot would be output.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=bug>BUG FIXES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are bugs or other issues with version 7.70, all of which have
been fixed in 7.80:</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>1. Parallel aspects bug:</span> In relationship
comparison charts, when the parallel aspects setting is active, parallel and
contraparallel aspects would be displayed as if the two charts were reversed.
This affected the relationship aspect grid (-r0 -gp switches) and the aspects
in the middle of bi-wheel charts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>2. Ray decoration omission:</span> Selecting the “Ray
12345” option in the Wheel Corners dropdown in Graphics Settings (and the
corresponding -YXv 5 switch) wouldn’t do anything when selected.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>3. Star retrogradation omission:</span> In the wheel
chart sidebar, fixed star objects wouldn’t ever show a “R” for being
retrograde, even when they were actually retrograde.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>4. Position comparison bug:</span> A comparison chart
(-r0 switch) between two charts with no time or space (such as produced with
the -o0 switch) wouldn’t preserve the two charts’ data, and therefore not work
right.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>5. Aspect grid day:</span> In the text mode
relationship comparison aspect grid (-r0 -g _X switches) the day of the week
displayed for chart #2 would be wrong, and be the same as the day of the week
of chart #1. Also, in the text mode relationship comparison aspect grid, if one
of the charts had no time or space, then the month displayed for the chart would
be garbage and potentially cause a crash.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>6. LMT midpoint inaccuracy:</span> The time space
midpoint chart (-rm switch) wouldn’t use the correct midpoint time if one or
both of the charts had a time zone of local mean time (LMT).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>7. Latitude crossing inaccuracy:</span> The text mode
astro-graph chart (-L0 _X switches) would sometimes display latitude crossings located
near the date line (180W/E) with wrong latitudes, such as taking place at above
90 degrees latitude.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>8. Transit 3D inaccuracy:</span> In the transit to
natal times chart (-t switch) transits into a new natal 3D house would be
displayed at wrong dates/times.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>9. Transit position display:</span> In the transit to
transit times chart (-d switch) if the rounded positions setting was on (-Yr
switch) then sign change events wouldn’t display the zodiac position of that
event as expected.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>10. Eclipse detection bug:</span> When detecting
whether a solar eclipse exists anywhere on Earth (-Yu0 switch) zero sized
objects like the Nodes would sometimes be displayed as being part of a partial
eclipse, which is impossible. Zero sized objects should either be an annular
transit once they touch the Sun’s disk, or not be an eclipse at all.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>11. Custom Earth limitation:</span> Attempting to set
a custom object to be the Earth or one of its apsis points would fail saying
the object index is out of range. This limitation would affect both the Object
Customization dialog, and the corresponding -YeO command switch.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>12. Degree symbol display:</span> In the Windows
version, when a text mode chart was being viewed, the degree symbol would be
corrupted and shown a different character in the Chart Info dialogs, when
looking up a city or displaying nearby cities. Also, in the Chart List dialog,
degrees would be displayed as just a colon when they should be the degree
symbol.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>13. Animate month glitch:</span> Animating or
incrementing the chart by month would sometimes result in an illegal day, such
as February 31. Now the day will be adjusted down if needed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>14. JPL Horizons limitation:</span> Calculating an
object using a JPL Horizons Web query would truncate the time used to the clock
second, losing any fractional second specified.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>15. Local space display:</span> In the graphic local
space chart (-Nl -X switches) displaying the detailed world map over a wide
enough area to cover more than 360 degrees of longitude would display garbage
for the background.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>16. Constellation line omission:</span> Constellation
lines (-YXU switch) would sometimes not be drawn on the globe chart if they
spanned a large enough horizontal distance.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>17. Calendar event display:</span> In the graphic
calendar chart with events included (-K -XA switches) events other than aspects
would always be displayed as thin lines, even if the thicker lines setting was
on and the text character scale large enough so the text could be drawn thicker.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>18. Custom background glitch:</span> When a bitmap
background is being used for graphics charts, wheel chart fills would still be
attempted, which would sometimes fill in just part of the area based on what’s
in the background. Bitmap backgrounds will now cause the wheel chart fill
setting to be ignored.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>19. Directory import display:</span> Loading all
charts in a directory (-id switch) would cause charts that were in the old
style formatting consisting of just numbers, to be loaded into the chart list
with names containing “(null)” at the end of them.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>20. PostScript bug:</span> Exporting to a Quick*Chart
format file would truncate the longitude and latitude to the arcminute, and
would always export zero for the seconds.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>21. Quick*Chart precision:</span> Exporting an
encapsulated PostScript file would produce a bad file that most utilities
couldn’t parse and display. Complete PostScript files were unaffected.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>22. War Time display:</span> Importing Solar Fire text
into the program wouldn’t parse War Time properly. The chart positions would
still be correct, but War Time wouldn’t be treated as Daylight Time. For
example, Astrolog would translate Eastern War Time (EWT) to “ST Zone 4W” when
it should be “DT Zone 5W”.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>23. Sidereal switch parsing:</span> The -s sidereal
zodiac switch would skip over the command switch after it, if that command
switch started with “-“. That’s because the -s switch takes an optional
parameter for the ayanamsa offset to use, and the starting dash was considered
the start of a negative number. Now the next character after the dash has to be
numeric, in order for it to be treated as a parameter to -s.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>24. Wheel subdivision error:</span> In the Windows
version, entering an illegal value in the Wheel Sign Subdivision Type field
would set the field to the illegal value &quot;Astrolog&quot;, and potentially
crash.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=express>ASTROEXPRESSION UPDATES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>AstroExpressions or “Astrolog Expressions” are programmable
customizations that don’t require recompiling the program, and can be
considered an extended form of command switches. AstroExpression functions and
related command switches have been updated in version 7.80. This section can be
ignored if one doesn’t use this feature area.</p>

<p class=A>The following lists all new AstroExpression functions. The name of
each function is listed, followed by the type of its return value and the
expected types of its parameters (if any). Numbers will automatically be
converted to Integer or Real as needed.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjAng:</span> Real(Int). Object angular diameter. Returns
the angular diameter of the specified object in the sky, in degrees.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Constel:</span> Int(RealX, RealY). Constellation
lookup. Converts a zodiac position and ecliptic latitude to the astronomical
constellation it lies within, returning 1-88.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>g0, _gm, _gp, _gd, _ga, _gx, _gs, _a0, _ad, _aa, _ax,
_as, _m0, _ma, _RO, _b1, _Yn1, _Yw, _Xx0, _Xv0, _Xk:</span> Int. Program
setting. This list of functions queries the Astrolog setting that’s set with
the identically named command switch.</p>

<p class=A>A few improvements or bug fixes have also been made in the
AstroExpression area:</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>AspOn bug:</span> The AspOn function was returning
whether an aspect was restricted, when it should return whether the aspect is
turned on.</p>
