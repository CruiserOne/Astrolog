<p class=FA>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=A>Release notes for Astrolog version 7.20 (April 2021):</p>

<p class=A>Happy New Moon everyone! :) This file describes the freeware
astrology software program Astrolog version 7.20 and the additions and fixes
made to it, over the previous version 7.10 which was released six months ago in
October 2020. The main things in this update are improved support for Dwarf
planets and planetary moons, detailed world maps and backgrounds, and 3D
midpoints.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=feature>NEW FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are new additions to version 7.20 that weren't in previous
versions:</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>1. Dwarf planets:</span> Astrolog supports nine new
objects related to Dwarf planets. These include the “Seven Dwarfs”, or the
seven largest confirmed or possible Dwarf planets located beyond Pluto, which
in decreasing size order are: Eris, Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar, Sedna,
and Orcus. Also included are asteroid “10 Hygiea” (which might also be a Dwarf
planet), and the centaur “5145 Pholus”. The new -u0 command switch will enable
(or disable) these nine objects. In the Windows version, these nine objects
have been added to the “Setting / Restrictions” and the “Setting / More Object
Settings” dialogs, and can be toggled on/off with the new “Setting / Include
Dwarfs” menu command or the “y” hotkey. These are full objects like any other,
in which graphic glyphs and simple interpretations are available too. Astrolog
has been able to display these minor objects since version 6.30, however they
required manual downloads and then configuring with the -Yeb and other command switches.
The ephemeris files for these bodies now come with all downloads of Astrolog,
so one can just point and click to show them. For more about the “Seven Dwarfs”
in astrology and their significance, see: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/astdwarf.htm">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/astdwarf.htm</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=V>2. Planetary moon objects:</span> Astrolog supports 32
new objects related to moons of other planets. These include 27 moons, and five
points for the actual center of body (COB) of Jupiter through Pluto (as opposed
to the planetary system barycenters which the standard planet objects cover).
Counting the nine Dwarf planet objects, Astrolog offers 41 new objects in this
version, and 131 objects total. The new -u8 switch will enable (or disable) the
27 moon objects, and the new -ub switch will enable the five center of body
objects. These are full objects like any other, and simple interpretations are
available too. Note the similarity in names of Saturn’s moon “Titan” with
Uranus’ moon “Titania”, which means that when specifying objects by name on the
command line that “Titan” or a substring of it will match Saturn’s Titan, and
at least the six characters “Titani” are needed to match Titania. Astrolog has
been able to display planetary moons since version 7.10, however they required
manual configuring with the -Yem and other switches. Planetary moon ephemeris
files still need to be downloaded separately from <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/ephem/moons/">http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/ephem/moons/</a>,
although the new object slots make them easy to work with now. For more about
planetary moons in astrology, see: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/astmoon.htm">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/astmoon.htm</a></p>

<p class=B>In the Windows version, the new “Setting / Planetary Moons” submenu
has several new commands for working with planetary moons. The “Include Moons”
and “Include Body Centers” will toggle the status of those objects (same as -u8
and -ub switches). The new “Moon Restrictions” command (similar to the existing
“Restrictions” and “Star Restrictions” commands on the Setting menu) will bring
up a new dialog allowing one to individually restrict or include each of the
moons related objects. The dialog has buttons to toggle the status of each
planet’s moons separately, so it’s easy to focus on (for example) just Saturn’s
moons if wanted.</p>

<p class=B>Also in the Windows version, the new “Moon Object Settings” command
(similar to the existing “Object Settings” and “More Object Settings” commands
on the Setting menu) will bring up a new dialog allowing one to individually
set the maximum orb, orb addition offset, influence power number, and color of
each moon object. The default for planetary moons is a two degree orb, the same
as fixed stars. Note the default virtual color “Planet”, which means to use the
same color as the planet the moon orbits, but darkened slightly (e.g. use
maroon for the moon’s color, if the planet the moon orbits is set to be red).
This dialog also has a checkbox “Make Moons Orbit Current Central Object” which
accesses the -Ym switch setting.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>3. Planetary moons chart:</span> Astrolog has a new
chart which will do a planetary moons report. This is the first time something
like this has become available to astrologers! :) To display it, use the new -8
command switch, or the “Setting / Planetary Moons / Moons Chart” in the Windows
version. This chart will show positions and aspects of all unrestricted planetary
moons (or all moons if they’re all restricted). If a planetary center of body object
is unrestricted, then it will be used as the position of the planet (otherwise
the standard barycenter planet object will be used). This chart is in seven
parts:</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>A: Moon positions:</span> The position of each
unrestricted moon is displayed in standard geocentric coordinates (or whatever
the current central body is), as well as in planet-centric coordinates relative
to the planet the moon orbits. Note standard geocentric coordinates will have
moons very close together, while the planet-centered positions can be evenly
distributed around the zodiac. All planet-centered positions will be displayed
in coordinates relative to Earth’s ecliptic (similar to how heliocentric charts
are done). In addition, each moon will show its orientation relative to its
planet and relative to Earth, in two ways: (1) Leading, ranging from +100% if
the moon is ahead of the planet in its orbit (both viewed from Earth and viewed
from the Sun), to -100% if the moon is trailing the planet. (2) Closeness,
ranging from +100% if the moon is closer to or between the planet and the
viewer (both viewed from Earth and viewed from the Sun), to -100% if the moon
is behind the planet or farther away from the viewer. Because “Lead” and
“Close” measure two things perpendicular to each other, together they add up to
100%. Values greater than 75% or less than -75% indicate the moon is prominent,
and will be highlighted in color, using the colors of the corresponding angles.
In interpretation, a “Leading” moon is somewhat similar to an object on the
Ascendant, and is a guiding influence that the planet being orbited is heading
towards. A “Following” moon is somewhat similar to an object on the Descendant,
and is a part of the planet being moved away from or that one has much
experience with. A “Close” moon is somewhat similar to an object on the
Midheaven, and is intense and obvious in its effect on the planet. A “Distant”
moon is somewhat similar to an object on the Nadir, and is subtle and internal
in its effect.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>B: Planet/moon overlaps:</span> This section displays
how close moons are to being conjunct with the planet they orbit, as viewed
from Earth (or whatever the current central body is). Because moons are very
close to their planet when viewed from other planets, these conjunctions are
only displayed if they’re precise, i.e. if moon’s disk overlaps (or almost
overlaps) the planet disk’s position in longitude. For this section, the moon
and planet must be within a number of moon disk widths equal to the normal orb
allowed in degrees. If the “print nearest second” setting is on, then the alignment
percentage will be displayed (which is positive ranging from 0% to 100%
depending on the horizontal alignment, or negative depending on how many moon
disk widths the moon and planet are apart horizontally). If the moon overlaps
the planet disk in latitude too, then there’s a transit or occultation taking
place between them, which will also be indicated. Eclipses between a moon and
its planet are one of the strongest influences in interpretation.
Interpretation text for these aspects will be included if interpretations (-I
switch) are turned on.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>C: Moon/moon overlaps:</span> This section displays
how close different moons orbiting the same planet are to being conjunct with
each other, as viewed from Earth. Like section B, these conjunctions are only
displayed if they’re precise, i.e. if the moons’ disks overlap each other in
longitude, or almost overlap within a number of moon disk widths of each other.
Eclipses visible from Earth will also be indicated, which means the two moons’
disks are aligned in vertical latitude too and actually overlap.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>D: Moon/planet aspects (planet-centered):</span> This
section displays aspects between moons and other planets, viewed from the
planet the moon orbits. If a moon is Conjunct or Opposite the Sun, then it will
be a New Moon or Full Moon as seen from that planet. In such a case, the moon
will also be planet-centric “Close” +/- 100% in section A. Similarly, a half
moon (moon Square Sun) will happen exactly when the moon is leading or trailing
the planet in its orbit, and the moon will also be planet-centric “Lead” +/-
100% in section A. An aspect of moon Conjunct or Opposite Earth will happen
when the moon is closest to or most distant from Earth, which means the moon
will be also geocentric “Close” +/- 100% in section A. To avoid too much data,
this section will only show Conjunction aspects by default (and Squares and
Oppositions to the Sun to catch moon phases), although if the “graphs include
all planets” setting in the Transits dialog is on (-B0 switch) then all
unrestricted aspects will be included.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>E: Moon/moon aspects (same planet-centered):</span> This
section shows aspects between moons orbiting the same planet, viewed relative
to the planet they orbit. It’s possible for conjunctions to be eclipses or disk
overlaps between the two moons, and if so they’ll be indicated.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>F: Moon/moon conjunctions (other planet-centered):</span>
This is identical to section E, but shows conjunctions between moons orbiting
different planets. In other words, this treats it as if the two moons were
orbiting the same planet, and checks for aspects relative to the virtual shared
center point. Eclipses in this section are still possible, however they will be
“virtual eclipses”, which means they would only be visible if the moons
actually did orbit the same body.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>G: Moon/planet conjunctions (overlayed):</span> This
section shows aspects between planet-centered moons and geocentric planets. In
other words, similar to section F this treats it as if the moon were orbiting
Earth instead, and checks for aspects relative to the virtual shared center
point. As with sections D and F, this will only show Conjunctions by default.
Moon phases and eclipses in this section will be “virtual”, which means they
would only be apparent if the moons actually did orbit Earth.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>4. Object customization:</span> In the Windows
version, the new “Object Customization” command on the “Setting / Planetary
Moons” submenu will bring up a dialog allowing one to customize 50 different
objects. This includes all objects in the Uranians, Dwarfs, and planetary moons
object categories. For each object slot, one can rename it, and change its
definition. Definitions are a number or an Astrolog object name, with optional
prefix and/or suffix letters. For numbers, no prefix means a minor planet or
asteroid with its own ephemeris file (e.g. “5” for asteroid “5 Astraea”), the
prefix “h” means a hypothetical planet from seorbel.txt (e.g. “h9” for Isis-Transpluto),
and the prefix “m” means a planetary moon (e.g. “m501” for Jupiter’s moon Io). If
a suffix is present, the characters “n”, “s”, “p”, and “a” will (instead of the
object’s position) compute the position of its north node, south node,
perihelion point, or aphelion point along its orbit. Also, the suffix
characters “H”, “S”, “B”, “N”, “T”, and “V” will toggle the heliocentric
setting (-h switch), sidereal zodiac setting (-s switch), barycenter setting
(-Yh switch), true node setting (-Yn switch), true positions setting (-YT
switch), and topocentric positions setting (-YV switch) for just this object
(which is useful if you want to for example include heliocentric nodes in a
geocentric chart).</p>

<p class=B>The “Lookup Names” button in this dialog will take any name slots
that are blank, and fill them out with a name based on the slot’s definition. This
button is useful if you want to verify that (for example) minor planet #1234 in
Swiss Ephemeris file se01234s.se1 is actually going to compute the asteroid “Elyna”
and not some other body. This is an improvement over previous versions of the
program, which could only customize via command line switches, and could only
customize the nine object slots in the Uranians category.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>5. Chart backgrounds:</span> Astrolog can display
pictures as a background for its charts. The new -XI switch will load the
specified Windows bitmap file (“.bmp” extension) and display it behind every
graphics or text chart. In the Windows version, the new “File / Open Bitmap /
Open Background” command will do the same. The bitmap contents will take the
place of the background color (which is usually black or white). An easy way to
get pictures into the Windows version of Astrolog is from your Web browser
right click on any picture and select “Copy image” or equivalent, and then do
“Edit / Paste” in Astrolog.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Background settings:</span> The new -XI0 switch allows
one to set the transparency and positioning of the background image, and takes
two parameters to cover both settings. The transparency parameter runs from 0
to 100, in which 0 means fully transparent and the background image is
invisible, and 100 means fully opaque and the background color doesn’t exist. The
default is 25, which ensures a black background will still be sufficiently dark
and a white background sufficiently light to not make viewing the chart itself
difficult. In the Windows version, the Graphics Setting dialog has a new
“Transparency Percentage of Background” field which controls this. The second
parameter for positioning may be 0, which means the background image is
stretched to cover the chart dimensions, or 1 or -1 which means the aspect
ratio of the original bitmap is preserved. 1 means the chart will always be
covered and the left/right or top/bottom edges of the background will be
cropped if the ratios don’t match (which is the default), and -1 means all of
the background will be displayed and the left/right or top/bottom edges of the
chart will remain the background color if the ratios don’t match.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>6. Detailed world maps:</span> Astrolog’s graphical
world map displays (which includes its astro-graph and nearest cities local
space charts) will now show a detailed picture of the world, instead of simple
line drawings along the coastlines that the program has done since version 2.00
released in 1991. For example, the globe display (-XG switch) will display a
“spherical bitmap”, rotated and tilted appropriately. Also, in the globe
displays (-XG &amp; -XP switches) if the “world map in Mollewide projection
setting” is on, then the night half of the world will be shaded darker. In the
Windows version, the new “Graphics / Map Effects / Use Detailed World Map”
command will toggle between the two options. The world map bitmap exists in the
file “earth.bmp” in the Astrolog install directory. You can edit or replace
that file, however for accurate results this file needs to be an equirectangular
projection of the world, in which the left and right edges are at 180 degrees
W/E. The new -XIW switch will load the specified Windows bitmap file and use it
for the world map bitmap instead. In the Windows version, the new “File / Open
Bitmap / Open World Map” command will do the same. The default earth.bmp uses
the NASA Visible Earth Blue Marble image <a
href="https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/74218/december-blue-marble-next-generation">https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/74218/december-blue-marble-next-generation</a>.
More detailed or alternate world maps that can be used with the -XIW switch, or
replace the default earth.bmp, are available at: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/map">http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/map</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=V>7. 24 bit bitmaps:</span> Astrolog now supports 24 bit
color Windows bitmaps, which can display 16 million colors per pixel (instead
of just a 16 color palette as before). Saving a file in Windows bitmap format,
or copying such a bitmap to the clipboard will generate the more detailed
bitmap. The new -Xbw switch indicates the default bitmap format is 24 bit
bitmaps, while the -Xbb switch will save smaller 16 color palette bitmaps. When
the palette is 16 colors, chart backgrounds and detailed world maps will be
disabled. In the Windows version, the new “Graphics / Map Effects / Use
Detailed World Map” command will toggle between the two options.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>8. AAF file format:</span> Astrolog supports the
Astrological Exchange Format for storing chart information (abbreviated AAF,
which stands for “Astrologisches Austauschformat” in German). This is a
sharable text format designed to allow different astrology programs (which
usually have their own private file formats) to read each others’ data. The new
-oa switch will save the current chart information to this format, and in the
Windows version the new “File / Save Chart AAF” command will save it. The -i
command switch and the “File / Open Chart” command in the Windows version will recognize
this format too. (If a file starts with the “#” character then it’s considered
an AAF file, otherwise it’s one of Astrolog’s standard script files.) Note that
you can load an Astrolog chart info file (e.g. “mychart.as”), save it as AAF,
load that AAF file, resave as “mychart2.as”, and get the original file back.
The <a href="http://www.astro.com">http://www.astro.com</a> site can show saved
charts in AAF format, if you click the “aaf” button in the “Stored Astro Data”
section of your profile. Once there, you can simply select the two lines of AAF
text for a chart, copy it to the clipboard, and do “Edit / Paste” in Astrolog as
a quick way to display your Astro.com profile charts in Astrolog.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>9. Clipboard paste:</span> In the Windows version, the
new “Edit / Paste” command will load whatever’s on the Windows clipboard into
Astrolog. If there’s text on the clipboard, then Astrolog will try to parse it
as a command line or a “.as” extension script file. If the text starts with “#”
then Astrolog will consider it to be AAF file content. If there’s a bitmap on
the clipboard, Astrolog will display it as the chart background. For example, in
your Web browser you can simply right click on any picture and select “Copy
image” or equivalent, and then do Paste in Astrolog to display it behind the
chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>10. Latitude and distance events:</span> The transit
to transit times chart (-d switch) can now also detect times of when a planet’s
latitude reaches highest or lowest, and when a planet reaches most or least
distance from the central object (i.e. reaches apoapsis or periapsis points).
Combined with the existing ability to detect when a planet goes retrograde or
direct, this chart has events for all axes in 3D spherical coordinates
(horizontal axis = zodiac position changing retrograde or direct, vertical axis
= latitude reaching high or low point, and distance axis = planet reaching
apoapsis or periapsis). The new -YR1 switch allows restricting whether these
latitude or distance events are included in the chart (which they are by
default, since these events are less commonly used). It takes two parameter
flags, with the first setting controlling latitude events, and the second distance
events.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>11. Nakshatras:</span> Astrolog can display zodiac
positions in Vedic Nakshatra format, which divides the zodiac into 27 equal
sized divisions of 13:20 degrees each (and each Nakshatra is in turn divided
into four quadrants or Padas). This is treated as a display format, similar to
zodiac position, hours/minutes, and number from 0-360 already supported. The
new -sn switch will display zodiac longitudes as Nakshatras, and in the Windows
version the new “Display Format / 27 Nakshatras” option in the Display Settings
dialog will do the same. For example, 0Lib00 will be displayed as “14Chit3”,
which means the 14th Nakshatra (named “Chitra”) and the 3rd Pada within it. If
the “print nearest second” setting is on, then the position will be displayed
with more detail: The Pada will indicate the fractional amount through it (e.g.
half way through Pada #1 will be displayed as “1.5”) and the corresponding
Navamsa sign to that Pada will be displayed (i.e. the sign abbreviation appended
to the position will be the same as the zodiac position as a whole if the -9
switch Navamsa mode were turned on). For example, 0Tau00:00 would be displayed
at “3Krit2.0Cp”, which means the 3rd Nakshatra (named “Krittika”) and the start
of the 2nd Pada within it (which corresponds to Capricorn in Navamsa).</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>12. Global eclipses:</span> Astrolog can flag
Conjunctions as solar eclipses in certain charts. However, eclipses are normally
only displayed as such if they’re visible from the location on Earth at the exact
time in question, which doesn’t help with determining whether a particular New
Moon is an eclipse. If the -Yu switch is invoked as -Yu0 instead, then Conjunctions
will be displayed as eclipses if they’re visible from anywhere on Earth, and
the type of eclipse (e.g. partial vs. total) and its percentage coverage will
be displayed as if one were optimally positioned on Earth where the eclipse is
at its maximum.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>13. JPL ephemeris:</span> The only thing more accurate
than the Swiss Ephemeris (and even then only slightly) is the JPL ephemeris
itself, of which the Swiss Ephemeris is a compressed version. Astrolog supports
doing calculations using the JPL ephemeris, with the new -bj command switch, or
in the Windows version by selecting the “JPL Ephemeris” option in the
“Calculation Method” dropdown of Calculation Settings. Using this option
requires the large 2.7 gigabyte file de431.eph to be downloaded from <a
href="ftp://www.astro.com/pub/jplfiles">ftp://www.astro.com/pub/jplfiles</a> and
placed in a directory where Astrolog can find it. (Note some browsers like
Chrome have FTP disabled by default.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>14. City lookup:</span> The new -zL switch will set
the chart longitude and latitude based on the specified city’s coordinates in
Astrolog’s atlas. It’s like the existing -zN switch, although that switch also
sets the time zone and Daylight fields of the chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>15. Custom Delta-T:</span> Astrolog takes into account
Delta-T when processing and displaying times, which means leap seconds which
are periodically inserted within certain years due to the very gradual slowing
of Earth’s rotation. The new -Yz0 switch allows one to manually specify the Delta-T
offset to use, in number of seconds, which may be useful for specialized
scenarios like comparing calculations between sources using different Delta-T
models.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>16. Custom planet size:</span> The new -YS switch will
set the diameter of the specified object to the given number of kilometers (or
miles if given with the suffix “mi”). This is relevant for eclipse detection
and charts which draw planet disks, especially if an object slot is customized
to be a different body. For example, if you’ve ever wanted to know what the
Moon would look like in our sky if it were as big as Jupiter, do “-YS Moo 142984”.
The result will be that the “Moon” now spans 22 degrees and is nearly 50 times
wider!</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>17. Star colors:</span> Fixed star objects can have
their color customized. The -YkO switch will now set the color to use for all
stars if you change the color of the first star object. If set to the new virtual
color “star”, then that means the default behavior of using orange for stars
brighter than magnitude 1.0, and dark red for dimmer stars. In the Windows
version, the More Object Settings dialog has a new dropdown alongside “All
Stars”, which allows one to set the color to use for them, which by default is
set to the virtual color &quot;Star&quot;.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>18. Alternate color palette:</span> In Astrolog the
“Reverse Background” command or -Xr switch may be used to draw the chart on a
white background. The problem is that normally won’t look good, because colors
like yellow, green, and cyan which look great on black become harder to see on
white. Astrolog now has an alternate color palette used for reverse background
mode, in which colors like yellow will be darker. The new -YXK0 switch (which
is on by default) controls whether this alternate color palette is used. Note
that manually changing palette colors with the -YXK switch will cause the user
specified RGB colors to always be used, regardless of this setting or the
background color.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>19. Global Triangles network:</span> The new -YXW switch
will draw a grid of triangles around the world in the globe and map displays,
overlaying any astro-graph lines or other things also on the world. If the one
argument that this switch takes is 0, then the grid is turned off. If the
argument is positive, then a grid of triangles is drawn based on an
icosahedron, with each triangle subdivided into smaller triangles a number of
times equal to the argument. If the argument is negative, then a grid of
squares is drawn based on a cube, with each square subdivided into smaller
squares a number of times equal to the magnitude of the argument.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>20. Constellation lines addition:</span> The new -YXU0
switch is like the existing -YXU, except it will append the lines to the
existing set, instead of replacing them. For example, that allows for an easy
way to define all constellations (with each constellation defined separately)
without having to compose one giant command switch for everything all at once.
Also, sequences of star indexes can be specified with the underscore character
between them “_” for easy definition of lines of stars. For example, another
way to define the Big Dipper is <span style='color:black'>“-YXU
Alkaid,Mizar,Alioth,Megrez,Phecda,Merak,Dubhe 0_1_2_3_4_5_6”</span></p>

<p class=A><span class=V>21. Chart slot setting:</span> The new -q2 switch is
like -q, except instead of directly setting the chart information in the active
chart, it will directly set the information in chart slot #2. This may be
invoked as -q1 through -q4 to set the specified slots, and all the other chart
indicators in the -i switch may be used with -q too.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>22. New house systems:</span> Astrolog supports six
new theoretical equal house systems. They don’t appear as Windows menu options,
but can be selected by the command line with the -c switch. Counting these,
Astrolog now supports 33 house systems total.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>East Point Equal houses (-c 27):</span> Standard Equal
houses places the 1st house at the Ascendant. East Point based Equal houses places
the 1st house at the East Point.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>East Point Whole houses (-c 28):</span> Standard Whole
houses places the 1st house at the start of the sign of the Ascendant. East
Point based Whole houses places the 1st house at the start of the sign of the
East Point.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>East Point Vedic houses (-c 29):</span> Standard Vedic
houses places the Ascendant in the middle of the 1st house. East Point based
Vedic houses places the East Point in the middle of the 1st house.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Antivertex Equal houses (-c 30):</span> Standard Equal
houses places the 1st house at the Ascendant. Antivertex based Equal houses places
the 1st house at the point of the Antivertex (i.e. 180 degrees opposite the
Vertex).</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Antivertex Whole houses (-c 31):</span> Standard Whole
houses places the 1st house at the start of the sign of the Ascendant.
Antivertex based Whole houses places the 1st house at the start of the sign of
the Antivertex (and the 7th house at the start of the sign of the Vertex).</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>Antivertex Vedic houses (-c 32):</span> Standard Vedic
houses places the Ascendant in the middle of the 1st house. Antivertex based
Vedic houses places the Antivertex in the middle of the 1st house (and the
Vertex in the middle of the 7th house).</p>

<p class=Section><a name=extend>EXTENDED AND IMPROVED FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A list of improvements to existing features in Astrolog 7.20, such
as new things you can now do with old features that you couldn’t do before, or
ways that existing features work better than before:</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>1. Vertical midpoints:</span> Astrolog’s midpoint list
chart (-m switch) will include the midpoints of latitudes as well, if the -gp
switch setting is on. For example, the vertical midpoint of a planet at +6
degrees ecliptic latitude and a planet at -1 ecliptic latitude is +2:30
latitude.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>2. 3D midpoints:</span> Astrolog’s midpoint list chart
(-m switch) and aspect/midpoint grid chart (-g switch) will do “3D midpoints”
based on the midpoint along the great circle between the two points on the
celestial sphere, if the 3D houses setting (-c3 switch) is on. Classic midpoints
only take the midpoint of zodiac position longitudes and completely ignore
latitude (or look at latitude separately). For example, the classic midpoint of
a planet at 0Ari and 0 latitude, and another planet at 0Leo and +89 latitude,
will just be 0Gem, however the 3D midpoint will be close to 0Ari and +45
latitude. If 3D midpoints are active, then one probably wants to turn on
vertical midpoints too, in order to also see the vertical latitude component of
the 3D midpoint.</p>

<p class=B>Also, time space midpoint charts (-rm switch) normally take the
midpoint of longitudes and the midpoint of latitudes separately to determine
the location of the resulting chart. If the 3D houses setting is on, then the
midpoint location will instead be the true midpoint along the great circle
between the two points on the globe.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>3. Additional fonts:</span> Astrolog supports seven
different fonts for display of signs, houses, planets, and aspects. They are
Astrolog’s default internal vector drawing, the Wingdings font from Windows
(signs only), the Astro font by Kenneth Hirst, the EnigmaAstrology font by Jan
Kampherbeek, generic high Unicode characters, the HamburgSymbols font by cat3,
and the Astronomicon font by Roberto Corona. Support for the Hamburg and
Astronomicon fonts is new to this version. (The Astronomicon font at <a
href="http://astronomicon.co/en/astronomicon-fonts/">http://astronomicon.co/en/astronomicon-fonts/</a>
is nice because it’s the first font which has glyphs for all of Astrolog’s standard
objects and aspects, including alternate versions.) The -YXf switch takes a
four digit number, which indicates which font to use for each area, in which
0=Astrolog, 1=Wingdings, 2=Astro, 3=Enigma, 4=Unicode, 5=Hamburg,
6=Astronomicon. In the Windows version, the Graphics Settings dialog has the
Hamburg and Astronomicon fonts added to the new font selection dropdowns.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>4. Astrocartography interpretations:</span> Interpretations
of each latitude crossing will now be inserted in the text mode astro-graph chart,
if interpretations are turned on (-L0 -I switches).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>5. 3D house interpretations:</span> Interpretations of
3D house change events will now be displayed within the transit to natal events
chart, when such events are included and when interpretations are turned on (-t
-c3 -I switches).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>6. Planetary moon eclipses:</span> Astrolog’s eclipse
detection will now display lunar eclipses involving other planets and their
moons, if the other planet is the central object. For example, a lunar eclipse
of Io behind Jupiter’s shadow is interesting, because fast moving Io passes
through penumbral and partial phases in under five minutes, but spends over two
hours in totality of Jupiter’s large shadow. Lunar eclipses of moons of other
planets can also be seen in Astrolog’s telescope chart (-XZ switch) however
that requires the moon to be the object the telescope is focused upon. (That’s
because the Earth’s or the other planet’s shadows are drawn as circles at the
moon’s distance, which requires knowing which moon is being considered.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>7. Planetary moon diameters:</span> Planetary moon objects
have their own diameters and disk sizes, and these disks can now be seen in the
graphic telescope chart (-XZ switch). They’re also visible in the solar system
orbit chart, although it requires zooming in quite a bit for their disks to be
more than one pixel wide. They’re visible in the local horizon charts too,
although since those charts show the whole sky, object disks won’t become
apparent unless the central object is set to something (such as a planetary
moon) located near a large body. Since 1993, Astrolog’s icon has been two moons
of different sizes orbiting a planet, and it can finally display images similar
to its icon in the program itself. :) For an example of Jupiter and its
different sized large Galilean moons, see: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/eclipsej.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/eclipsej.gif</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=W>8. Zoomed label detail:</span> The telescope and local
space charts will display axes on the edges of the chart to the nearest arc minute
(and no longer only to the degree), if the chart is zoomed in enough.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>9. Saturn’s rings:</span> The telescope chart (-XZ
switch) will now display rings around Saturn, tilted and rotated appropriately.
Ellipses will be drawn at the most visible boundaries of Saturn’s rings, specifically
at the outer limit of Saturn’s “A” ring and the inner limit of Saturn’s “B”
ring. Note that Saturn’s axis is currently hardcoded, however its precession is
a very slow 1.83 million year cycle, so it stays reasonably accurate. For
example, Astrolog correctly shows the nearest dates when Earth crosses Saturn’s
ring plane (Sep 4, 2009 and March 23, 2025). Astrolog’s icon has been a ringed
planet since 1993, and it can finally display images similar to its icon within
the program itself. :) For an example of Saturn and its rings viewed from
Saturn’s moon Iapetus, see: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/moonssat.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/moonssat.gif</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=W>10. Telescope mouse drag:</span> When the telescope
and local space charts are zoomed in, right clicking and dragging with the
mouse will move the view by a proportionally slower rate. This is much better
than before, in which clicking and dragging would always move at the same rate,
causing everything to quickly fly off the screen at high zoom values.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>11. Telescope eclipse improvement:</span> The telescope
chart (-XZ switch) will always draw the umbra of Earth’s shadow in front of the
Moon, and the penumbra of Earth behind the Moon. This makes lunar eclipses look
more realistic, in that a bite will appear out of the Moon when it enters the
umbra. For an example of this in a Total Lunar Eclipse, see: <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/eclipsel.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/eclipsel.gif</a></p>

<p class=A><span class=W>12. Telescope mirror option:</span> When the telescope
chart (-XZ switch) is aligned with Earth’s ecliptic (-XL switch) zodiac
positions are displayed increasing from left to right, as might be expected.
However, when looking up at the ecliptic in the sky (at least in the Northern
hemisphere) zodiac positions increase from right to left, so the telescope
shows a mirror image of what’s actually in the sky. To counter this, if the
harmonic chart setting is negative (i.e. “-x -1”) then the chart will be
flipped horizontally.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>13. Graphic transit years:</span> The graphic transit
charts (-B/-V switches) used to always cover either one year or five years,
with nothing in between. They will now respect the “Years to Span” value in
Transit Settings, and cover spans up to 20 years. Five years is still the default
if one selects “Range of Years” without specifying a number. When doing this on
the command line, note that the -BY/-VY switches don’t take a year parameter
(because five years is still the default) so the number of years needs to be
set with a different switch like -EY (e.g. “-EY 10 _E” to set the number of
years, but not also turn on the -E chart).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>14. Biorhythm average:</span> The graphic biorhythm
chart (-rb -X switches) will include a fourth line for the average of the Physical,
Emotional, and Intellectual lines, if the “Modify Display” setting (-Xi switch)
is on. Right clicking on the biorhythm window will bring up a new context menu
allowing one to select this option.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>15. Bi-wheel improvement:</span> A circle (colored
green by default) will be drawn between the two chart rings in the bi-wheel
chart. This is similar to how green circles are already drawn between the rings
of tri-wheels and quad-wheels.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>16. Scrolling improvement:</span> In the Windows
version, if while viewing a text mode chart, one scrolls to the right beyond
all text, then the program will automatically scroll to the left until at least
some columns are visible again. This is similar to the existing functionality of
how if one scrolls down below all text, then the program will automatically
scroll up until some rows are visible again.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>17. Customization improvement:</span> When redefining
an object slot with the -Ye switch, Astrolog will now automatically query the
name of that object and change the name of the object slot too, and also turn
off the object’s glyph so it’s displayed as an abbreviation of its new name.
Before, renaming the object and redefining or turning off its glyph had to be
done separately.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>18. Swiss Ephemeris version:</span> Astrolog now uses
Swiss Ephemeris version 2.10, which includes among other things a fix to slightly
improve the accuracy of the Moon’s latitude.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>19. TZ database updated:</span> Astrolog’s time zone
change information has been updated to use TZ database version “2021a” (instead
of “2020a” which was used before). This new version has a few subtle
corrections and improvements to various areas in the world.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=change>PROGRAM CHANGES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A few changes that aren't new feature additions or bug fixes have
been made to Astrolog 7.20, which means certain old assumptions are no longer
valid. Most can be considered improvements, but they still change existing
behavior. A list of these follows (which aren't useful to be aware of unless
you have used previous versions of the program):</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>1. Central object position:</span> In other planet
centered charts (that are something other than geocentric or heliocentric) the
position of the central planet itself if unrestricted will be the position 180
degrees opposite the Sun (and no longer the position opposite the Earth).</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>2. Ley lines interface:</span> Ley lines (involving an
interlocking icosahedron and dodecahedron) will now be displayed on the
rectangular world map chart (when the -Xi modify display setting is on) if the
new -YXW switch is non-zero. Ley lines used to be displayed here (when -Xi is
on) when the 3D houses setting was on. Note that when the -Xi modify display
setting is off, then the -YXW switch setting will display a different grid of
triangles or squares over any of the world map charts.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=bug>BUG FIXES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are bugs or other issues with version 7.10, all of which have
been corrected in 7.20:</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>1. Planet centered chart inaccuracy:</span> Charts
centered on other planets (something other than geocentric or heliocentric)
wouldn’t support light time apparent positions correctly, and would use the
light time for delay for heliocentric distances. That required one to use true
positions to get accurate results. With increased support for planetary moons,
it’s important to do both correctly.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>2. Local horizon inaccuracy:</span> Local horizon
charts (which include astro-graph) should produce positions independent of
zodiac settings (i.e. whether tropical or sidereal, including any sidereal
ayanamsa). These charts would move and therefore be inaccurate if the ayanamsa
or zodiac degree offset setting was non-zero.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>3. Latitude crossing omission:</span> The astro-graph
chart’s list of latitude crossings (-L0 switch) would not include some
crossings if they took place near 180 degrees W/E longitude. This known issue
had been present in the program since version 2.10 released in 1992, and is
finally fixed now. :)</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>4. 3D house transit bug:</span> Transit to natal
events of a planet entering a new 3D house (-t -c3 switches) would display the
planet’s current zodiac position incorrectly if the “print nearest second”
setting (-b0 switch) was on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>5. 3D house transit restriction bug:</span> Transit to
natal events of a planet entering a new 3D house (-t -c3 switches) wouldn’t
respect house cusp object restrictions correctly. For example, restricting the
natal Ascendant would cause most 3D house change events to not be displayed,
regardless of which 3D house was being entered.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>6. 3D house interpretation crash:</span>
Interpretation of transit to natal events for a planet entering a new 3D house
(-t -c3 switches) wouldn’t be displayed and would often crash.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>7. Constellation labeling bug:</span> Constellations
in the world map display (-XW switch) would not be labeled correctly with their
abbreviations, and their labels would always appear just as dots.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>8. Constellation lines omission:</span> When
constellations were being displayed, in two places a boundary line segment
between two constellations that was supposed to be drawn, would be missing.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>9. Ray rulership omission:</span> Ray rulerships
wouldn’t be shown in the standard text listing (-v switch), unless the Esoteric
Astrology chart (-7 switch) was displayed first.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>10. Sector velocity inaccuracy:</span> In Gauquelin
sector charts (-l switch) the velocity of planets would be inaccurate, because
the velocity values being displayed were from the end of the day instead of the
chart time.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>11. Save background error:</span> In the Windows version,
the commands on the “File / Save As Wallpaper” submenu would work correctly,
but also caused a memory leak error message to be displayed when the program
exited.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>12. Aspect interpretation omission:</span> Interpretations
of the aspect grid and aspect list chart (-g and -a switches) would not display
an interpretation for aspects between two cusp objects. Also, the aspect grid
would not display an interpretation between a cusp and Uranian object.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>13. Printer output glitch:</span> In the Windows
version, printing a text mode chart would include bad characters for certain
symbols. Printing now turns off DOS graphics characters to ensure printing of
text charts works on modern printers.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>14. HTML color limitation:</span> HTML text generated
would always use the default color palette, and wouldn’t use color palette
changes made with the -YXK switch.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>15. Telescope Earth display:</span> In the graphic
telescope chart, the Earth wouldn’t display properly when it’s viewed from
other bodies. Earth would never appear as a crescent or with any shadow upon it
regardless of angle. Also, the Earth would always be drawn behind all other
planets, regardless of how close it actually is.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>16. Moon orbit limitation:</span> In the graphic solar
system orbit chart (-S -X switches) logarithmic orbit distances wouldn’t affect
the Moon and Node objects. All moon related objects that orbit planets
(including all 27 planetary moons) will now be displayed an appropriate
distance from their planet, allowing an astronomically accurate display of the
Sun and all planets, in which all moons around those planets will also be
visible at the correct angle around them.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>17. Angle latitude inaccuracy:</span> In other planet
centered charts, the house cusp objects would change ecliptic latitude from 0.0,
which shouldn’t happen since they’re always geocentric objects.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>18. Transit graph display:</span> In the graphic
transit graph charts (-B/-V -X switches) the maximum height of peaks would
sometimes not be marked with a white line, if there were two points of the exact
same height adjacent to each other.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>19. Wireframe display:</span> 3D wireframe files saved
of Astrolog’s globe chart (-XG -X3 switches) would be generated with extremely
wide sign boundaries, if the 3D houses setting was on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>20. Sidebar display glitch:</span> The wheel chart
graphics sidebar normally allows 25 characters to fit within each row.
Unfortunately, if there are 10 or more objects in each quadrant, the quadrant
counts line will be 26 characters, and cause the last character to overlap the
right edge. Now, if any line is 26 or more characters, then it will be offset
slightly to the left.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>21. Compilation error:</span> The Astrolog 7.10
sources wouldn’t compile if certain compile time options were disabled. Specifically,
compiling with GRAPH turned off would result in several errors.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=express>ASTROEXPRESSION UPDATES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>AstroExpressions or “Astrolog Expressions” are programmable
customizations that don’t require recompiling the program, and can be
considered an extended form of command switches. AstroExpression functions and
related command switches have been updated in version 7.20. This section can be
ignored if one doesn’t use this feature area.</p>

<p class=A>The following lists all new AstroExpression functions. The name of
each function is listed, followed by the type of its return value and the
expected types of its parameters (if any). Numbers will automatically be
converted to Integer or Real as needed. “Num” means either type is handled,
without any conversion needed.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Tween:</span> Bool(Num, Num1, Num2): Between. Returns
whether Num lies within the range of Num1 to Num2. This is basically a
shorthand version of “And Gte &lt;Num&gt; &lt;Num1&gt; Lte &lt;Num&gt; &lt;Num2&gt;”.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>ObjDay:</span> Real(Int). Object day length. Returns
an object’s length of day or how long it takes to rotate upon its axis, in
hours.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>RAMC:</span> Real: Right Ascension of Midheaven. Returns
the RAMC in degrees (0-360) for the most recently cast chart.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DeltaT:</span> Real: Delta-T. Returns the Delta-T
offset in seconds for the most recently cast chart.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>JulianT:</span> Real(IntM, IntD, IntY, Real): Julian
Time. Returns the Julian time for the given month, day, year, and time in
hours.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>AspLon:</span> Int(Int1, Int2, IntV): Aspect check.
Returns whether there’s an aspect between objects in the current chart
indicated by Int1 and Int2, taking into account all orb settings. If an aspect
is present, then custom variable IntV (if a valid variable index) will be set
to the orb between them in degrees.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>AspLon2:</span> Int(Int1, Int2, IntV): Relationship aspect
check. Like AspLon but checks for an aspect between planet positions in the
first two chart slots.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>AspLat:</span> Int(Int1, Int2, IntV): Parallel aspect
check. Like AspLon but checks for parallel or contraparallel aspects between
planet positions in the current chart.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>AspLat2:</span> Int(Int1, Int2, IntV): Relationship parallel
aspect check. Like AspLat but checks for an aspect between planet positions in
the first two chart slots.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DoGrid:</span> Bool. Make aspect grid. Compose the
internal aspect/midpoint grid for the planet positions in the most recently
cast chart, as used in certain Astrolog charts, and as accessed via the GridNam
and GridVal functions. Returns whether creating the grid succeeded.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DoGrid2:</span> Bool(Bool). Make relationship aspect
grid. Compose the internal aspect grid (or midpoint grid if the parameter is
True) for the planet positions in the first two chart slots, as used in certain
Astrolog charts, and as accessed via the GridNam and GridVal functions. Returns
whether creating the grid succeeded.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>_Yz0, _Yu0:</span> Bool or Real: Program setting. This
list of functions queries the Astrolog setting that’s set with the identically
named command switch.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>_XI1, _XI2, _Xr, _Xm, _XT, _Xi, _Xuu, _Xll, _XA, _XL,
_Xj, _XF, _XW0, _Xee, _XU, _XC, _XQ, _XN, _YXe, _Xwx, _Xwy, _Xnn, _Xs, _XSS,
_XU0, _XE1, _XE2, _XE, _XL0, _X1, _XGx, _XGy, _XZ:</span> Bool or Int or Real:
Program graphics setting. This list of functions queries the Astrolog graphics setting
that’s set with the identically named command switch. There are only a few
exceptions: Functions _Xuu, _Xee, _Xnn, and XSS access the -Xu, -Xe, -Xn, and
-XS switch settings, and repeat the letter of the command switch in their names
to avoid a case insensitive name conflict with _XU, _XE, _XN, and _Xs.
Functions _XI1 &amp; _XI2, _Xwx &amp; _Xwy, _XGx &amp; _XGy access the two
parameters passed to the -XI0, -Xw and -XG switches.</p>

<p class=A>There are several new command switches which allow one to define
AstroExpression “hooks” into areas of chart calculation or display, to modify
or filter their results. All AstroExpression related command switches start
with the tilde (~) character:</p>

<p class=B><span class=V>1. ~j0 &lt;string&gt;:</span> Adjust sign influence
powers. Called when a chart’s sign powers are computed in the text mode -j0
influence charts. On entry, @y is the sign, and @z is its power. Return value
is ignored, although if you update @z it will be the new power used. For
example, to give an extra 200 relative power to fire signs, do: <span class=Y>~j0
&quot;If Equ Mod @y 4 1 =z Add @z 200.0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>2. ~dv &lt;string&gt;:</span> Determine void of course
times. Called when the transit to transit times chart (-d switch) decides
whether an aspect indicates a void of course event. On entry, @v is 0 if checking
whether this event starts void of course and @v is 1 if checking whether this
event ends void of course, @w is the first object forming the event, @x is the
aspect or other event (-1: sign change, -2: direction change, -3: degree
change), @y is the second object forming the event (or new sign if that event),
and @z is the default decision for whether this marks void of course moon.
Return value is ignored, although if @z is changed it will be the new indicator
for void of course. For example, to detect and display void of course Sun times
(i.e. the period between the last aspect the Sun makes before the Sun enters
the next sign) instead of void of course Moons, do: <span class=Y>~dv &quot;=z
?: @v And Equ @w O_Sun Equ @x -1 And Equ @w O_Sun Gt @x 0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>3. ~F[O/C/A] &lt;string&gt;:</span> Font adjustment.
Called each time a real font character is displayed in the Windows version, and
allows customizing its display. This can be used to change which glyphs are
displayed for which characters, and where. On entry, custom variable @u is
Astrolog’s index for what’s being drawn (i.e. which sign, object, house, or
aspect depending on the command switch defined), @v is the font character
(usually between 32-127 for low Ascii), @w is the font index (1=Wingdings, 2=Astro,
3=Enigma, 4=Unicode, 5=Hamburg, 6=Astronomicon), @x and @y are the pixel coordinates
where the glyph will be drawn (which can be adjusted to move glyphs that seem
off-center), and @z is the relative scale percentage (which can be adjusted for
glyphs that seem too large or too small). Return value is ignored, although if
any of @v through @z are modified they will be used to draw the glyph instead.
For example, to randomly display sign glyphs using one of the first four fonts
available, do: <span class=Y>~F &quot;=w Rnd 1 4 =v Add @u ?: Equ @w 1 93 ?: Equ
@w 2 64 ?: Equ @w 4 9799 ?: Lte @u 9 48 ?: Equ @u 10 38 ?: Equ @u 11 34
49&quot;</span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>4. ~U &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter extra star output.
On entry, custom variable @v is the star index, @w is the star’s zodiac
position longitude, @x is the star’s latitude, @y is the star’s velocity, and
@z is the star’s magnitude. For example, to only display stars brighter than
magnitude 3.0 (which will reduce the number of stars from over 1000 to 172) do:
<span class=Y>~U </span><span class=Y><span style='font-weight:normal'>&quot;</span>Lt
@z 3.0</span><span class=Y><span style='font-weight:normal'>&quot;</span></span></p>

<p class=B><span class=V>5. ~U0 &lt;string&gt;:</span> Filter extra asteroid output.
On entry, custom variable @w is the asteroid index, @x is the asteroid’s zodiac
position longitude, @y is the asteroid’s latitude, and @z is the asteroid’s
velocity. For example, to only display asteroids that are located within 10
great circle degrees from the Sun, do: <span class=Y>~U0 &quot;Lt PolDist @x @y
ObjLon O_Sun ObjLat O_Sun 10.0&quot;</span></p>

<p class=A>A few improvements, changes, or bug fixes have also been made in the
AstroExpression area:</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Aspect adjusting extended:</span> The ~A switch now
affects parallel and contraparallel aspects too. In this case, when the AstroExpression
is invoked, @w will contain A_Par or A_CPr.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>Object ordering limitation:</span> The ~v object
ordering switch wouldn’t affect certain charts, such as the transit graphs
(-B/-V switches), and the aspect list when its ordering is based on object
(-aO/-aP switches).</p>
