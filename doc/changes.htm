<p class=FA>                         **  VERSION 7.50  **</p>

<p class=FA>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=A>Release notes for Astrolog version 7.50 (September 2022):</p>

<p class=A>This file describes the freeware astrology software program Astrolog
version 7.50 and the additions and fixes made to it, over the previous version 7.40
which was released over five months ago in March 2022. The main things in this
update are dial charts, North and South Indian charts, traditional sign
divisions, and extended wheel charts with planetary moons orbiting planets.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=feature>NEW FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are new additions to version 7.50 that weren't in previous
versions:</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>1. Dial midpoint wheels:</span> Astrolog supports dial
wheel charts with midpoint trees, as used in Uranian astrology. To display it, bring
up Astrolog’s midpoint chart with graphics mode on (using the “Chart / Midpoint
List” menu command, or with the -m -X command switches). The dial used is based
on the harmonic chart factor setting, in which a harmonic factor of 1 is a 360
degree dial, 2 is a 180 degree dial, 3 is a 120 degree dial, 4 is a 90 degree
dial, and so on. Dials may also be specified in number of degrees covered, in
which the “harmonic chart factor” field in the Calculation Settings dialog, and
the parameter to the -x switch on the command line, may have the prefix “d” to
indicate a dial degree instead of a harmonic chart factor. For example,
entering “4” or “d90” will both do a 90 degree dial. As with other charts, one
can right mouse click on it in the Windows version to view a context menu,
allowing one to toggle relevant settings.</p>

<p class=B>The dial chart will have a red arrow crossing the wheel pointing to
the focus planet or degree, and it can be interactively moved by pressing the
left and right arrow keys, or by clicking and dragging the right mouse button.
The “telescope focuses on this object” field in the Graphics Settings dialog
(which is also the parameter to the -XZ switch) will indicate the object for
the dial to focus upon. If that field is empty and not set to a planet, then
the dial will point to the degree indicated in the “horizontal map degree
rotation” field in Graphics Settings (which is also the parameter to the -XW
switch).</p>

<p class=B>The dial will also draw lines between planets which have the focus
point as their midpoint. These lines will use the orb of the Conjunction aspect
to determine how wide to allow lines. The middle of the chart will list these
midpoints, showing the two objects forming the midpoint, the angle in dial
degrees between them, and the orb or how offset the midpoint is from exact. This
midpoint list can be sorted in several different ways, based on the “sort
aspect list by” field in the Chart Settings dialog (which is also set by the -a
subswitch). Specifically, you can sort by aspect i.e. angle (the default), by
orb, or by object index. Note that the “3D aspects” setting will apply to these
midpoints, and if enabled will calculate 3D midpoints based on great circles
that take ecliptic latitude into account, instead of just midpoints based on
zodiac position only. If the “Show Equator” setting is on (-Xe switch) then
instead of a dial and midpoint tree, standard aspects between points around the
wheel will be drawn.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>2. North/South Indian style wheels:</span> Astrolog
can display North Indian and South Indian style wheel charts, as used in Indian
astrology. To display them, use the new “Graphics / Indian Style Wheels” menu
command (or the new -XJ switch on the command line). This setting will modify
the standard wheel chart (“Chart / Standard Radix” menu command, or the -v -X
switch combination) and the house wheel chart (“Chart / House Wheel” command, or
the -w -X switch combination) to draw Indian wheels instead of Western. Planets
in sign or house areas will be labeled with their glyphs, although if the “show
glyph labels” setting (-Xl switch) is off, then planets will instead be labeled
with their two letter abbreviation as is commonly done with Indian charts. Glyphs
or abbreviations will be arranged in position order within a sign/house, from
top to bottom or from left to right. If the “text house wheel reverses object
order” setting is on (-w0 switch) then glyphs will instead be arranged in
reverse order in parts of the wheel that progress from bottom to top or from
right to left. As with other charts, one can right mouse click on it in the
Windows version to view a context menu, allowing one to toggle relevant
settings, and easily switch between Western and North/South Indian charts.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>South Indian:</span> The South Indian chart consists
of 12 boxes (one for each sign) arranged around a square. In this chart, Pisces
is the upper left box, and signs increase clockwise (which is the opposite
direction of standard Western wheel charts). Each box will be labeled with its
sign, and if the house system is one in which house boundaries exactly coincide
with signs (such as Whole or Null) then each box will be labeled with its house
too. Either way, the sign containing the 1st house cusp will be highlighted
with two diagonal lines, to make it more visible. If the “Indian wheel order”
setting (-J switch) is on then arrangement will instead be similar to a Western
wheel, with the sign containing the first house on the left edge, and signs
increasing counterclockwise. The square space in the middle of the chart will
have an aspect/midpoint grid drawn within it, for as many planets as there’s
room for, unless the “show equator” setting is on (-Xe switch). Because South
Indian chart boxes are signs, this chart is displayed with the standard “Chart
/ Standard Radix” command, when “Indian Style Wheels” are on.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>North Indian:</span> The North Indian chart consists
of 12 diamond or triangle shaped areas (one for each house) arranged to compose
a square. Angular houses will be in the larger diamond shaped areas near the
middle. Each box will be labeled with its house, and if the house system is one
in which house boundaries exactly coincide with signs (such as Whole or Null)
then each box will be labeled with its sign too. In this chart, the 1st house
is the top diamond, and signs increase counterclockwise. If the “Indian wheel
order” setting is on (-J switch) then arrangement will be more similar to a
Western wheel, with the chart being rotated 90 degrees so that the first house
is the diamond on the left edge. Because North Indian chart boxes are houses, this
chart is displayed with the “Chart / House Wheel” command, when “Indian Style
Wheels” are on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>3. Traditional wheel chart divisions:</span> Astrolog
can divide the signs of the zodiac in various ways as used in traditional or
Indian astrology, and display these subsections around graphic wheel charts,
and in text listings. The new “Wheel Sign Subdivision Type” dropdown in the
Chart Settings dialog (which is also accessible via a new optional numeric
parameter to the -v3 switch) indicates the type of sign subdivision to display.
This dropdown replaces the old “Standard Radix Chart Shows Decan Positions”
checkbox in the dialog, which was limited to only displaying one type of
division. In graphic wheel charts, the sign wheel will be subdivided
appropriately, with each section labeled with a sign, planet, or number. In the
standard text mode chart, the rightmost column will (as long as the “Print
Nearest Second” setting or -b0 switch is on) display the placement of each
planet within the selected division type. Note the ~v3 switch AstroExpression
can be used to modify these divisions (i.e. how each section is sized and
labeled) or create completely new ones. The nine sign subdivision types are:</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>1) Decan Ruler:</span> Each sign is trisected into
three equal 10 degree sections, showing traditional decans or faces. Each decan
is labeled with the planet that rules (based on rulership settings) the sign
associated with that third of the original sign. This sign subdivision was the
only option available in previous versions of Astrolog.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>2) Decan Sign:</span> This option marks decans or
faces with the signs themselves, as opposed to the planets which rule those
signs. This sign subdivision could be done in previous versions of Astrolog by
setting the ~v3 switch AstroExpression appropriately, for which an example was
given in the documentation for the ~v3 switch.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>3) Chaldean Decan:</span> Decans or faces are marked using
the Chaldean method, by repeating the seven visible planets around the zodiac.
This sign subdivision could be done in previous version of Astrolog by setting
the ~v3 switch AstroExpression appropriately, for which an example was given in
the documentation for the ~v3 switch.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>4) Egyptian Term:</span> Each sign is subdivided into
five unequal sized areas between 2 and 12 degrees, each of which is associated
with one of the five planets from Mercury through Saturn, as indicated by
Egyptian terms or bounds.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>5) Ptolemaic Term:</span> Each sign is subdivided into
five unequal sized areas between 3 and 8 degrees, each of which is associated
with one of the five planets from Mercury through Saturn, as indicated by
Ptolemaic terms or bounds. Other term arrangements can be configured with the
~v3 switch AstroExpression, in which the documentation for that switch gives an
example to show Chaldean terms.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>6) Navamsa:</span> Each sign is subdivided into nine
equal areas of 3:20 degrees each, as defined in Indian astrology Navamsas. Each
section is labeled with a sign of the zodiac, and these zodiac signs increase
around the wheel. That makes it equivalent to the 9th harmonic chart, in which
each planet will be in a section labeled with the sign it would move to if the
harmonic chart factor were set to 9.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>7) 12th Harmonic:</span> Each sign is divided into 12
equal 2.5 degree sections, based on the 12th harmonic in which the first
section of each sign is associated with Aries, the second Taurus, and so on.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>8) Dwad:</span> Also called dwadasamsa or dodecatemoria,
the dwad division is similar to the 12th harmonic division above, except each
sign labels sections starting with its own sign, instead of Aries.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Z>9) Nakshatra:</span> This shows the Nakshatra division
used in Vedic astrology. The wheel of the zodiac is divided into 27 equal sized
areas of 13:30 degrees each, and each section is labeled with the number 1-27.
Since nine of the Nakshatras overlap sign boundaries, both halves of them will
be labeled with that number. The text mode version of this division will not
only list the Nakshatra number, but also a four letter abbreviation of the
lunar mansion name, like as done when the “Display Format” setting is set to
“27 Nakshatras” (-sn switch).</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>4. Planetary moon wheels:</span> Astrolog offers a new
wheel chart variation which shows planetary moons orbiting planets. The wheel
chart will be displayed as normal, except unrestricted planetary moon objects
will be drawn around the glyph of the planet they orbit. Since each planet is
now a mini-wheel chart, this is effectively a “wheels within wheels” chart. To
show this, turn on the new “Wheel Charts Show Moons Orbiting Planet” checkbox
in the Planetary Moon Object Settings dialog, or use the new -X8 switch. Moons
will be displayed using their first letter, or as a lower case version of the
first letter, if the letter is already in use by an earlier indexed moon of
that planet. For example, Saturn’s moon Titan will be displayed as “T”, while
Saturn’s moon Tethys will be “t”. Moon letters will be placed relative to their
orientation to the viewer, and will be highlighted based on which of the four
prominence zones they’re in. (These moon prominence zones are somewhat
analogous to the four Gauquelin sector plus zones.) Moons which are leading the
planet in its orbit will be highlighted in red, moons which are following the
planet in its orbit will be in green, moons which are close or between the
planet and the viewer will be yellow, moons which are distant or behind the
planet will be blue, and moons not in any zone will be gray. Moon letters will
be distributed around the planet glyph such that letters don’t overlap, similar
to how planet glyphs don’t overlap in the main wheel.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>5. Atmospheric refraction:</span> Astrolog now supports
taking into account atmospheric refraction in local horizon positions, which
will affect the apparent altitude of objects. To enable this, turn on the new
“Local Horizon Positions Apply Atmospheric Refraction” checkbox in the
Calculation Settings dialog, or use the new -Yf switch. Refraction is
influenced by temperature (in which colder temperatures cause denser atmosphere
and more refraction), by elevation above sea level (in which higher elevations
have thinner atmosphere and less refraction), and by initial altitude (in which
objects nearer the horizon pass through more atmosphere and are offset more). In
a cold environment at sea level, objects near the horizon can be offset by over
half a degree in altitude due to refraction. The temperature to use for a chart
is specified in the Default Chart Info dialog, or with the new -zf switch.
Temperature can be specified in degrees Celsius (the default or by including a
“C” suffix), or in degrees Fahrenheit (by including an “F” suffix). Atmospheric
refraction when enabled will affect Astrolog’s local horizon chart, its Gauquelin
sector chart which is based on local horizon positions, it’s rising and setting
charts, chart spheres, and the placement of planets in 3D houses when arranged
along the prime vertical.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>6. Node crossing events:</span> Astrolog’s transit to
transit times chart (-d switch) now has the ability to detect events where the
latitude of a planet crosses zero (i.e. crosses a nodal point). Enable these
events with the new “Latitude Zero Crossing” checkbox in the Transits dialog, or
on the command line with the new -YR2 switch, which takes two parameters the
first of which indicates the restriction status of north and south node crossings.
These events will be displayed in charts as “LA0 North” and “LA0 South”. The
North Node is where an object crosses a plane from negative to positive
altitude, while the South Node is where it crosses a plane from positive to
negative altitude.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>7. Equal distance events:</span> Astrolog’s transit to
transit times chart (-d switch) and transit to natal times chart (-t switch)
now have the ability to detect events where two planets are of equal distance
from the observer. Enable this event with the new “Distances Equal” checkbox in
the Transits dialog, or on the command line with the new -YR2 switch, which takes
two parameters the second of which indicates the restriction status of
equidistant events. This event will be displayed as “EqD” in charts. This
effectively introduces a new aspect type along the distance axis, similar to
how standard aspects measure alignment along the horizontal or longitude axis,
and how parallel and contraparallel aspects measure alignment along the
vertical axis. Note that some planet pairs will never be equidistant from each
other, such as outer planets (which are always far away) with inner planets
(which are always relatively close).</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>8. Custom glyph copying:</span> The new -YXDD subswitch
will copy a graphic glyph from one object to another. It takes two parameters,
one for the object index to change, and another for the object index to copy
the glyph from. This switch allows one to have a custom object slot be a copy
of a planet, without having to manually recreate the planet’s glyph in the new
slot.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>9. Output extra text:</span> The obscure new -YYt switch
will output the specified text. It can be used to append text to a text mode
chart, or even work within an AstroExpression hook, if one calls the “Switch”
AstroExpression function to execute a command line containing the switch. In
the switch’s string parameter, the character sequence “\n” will be translated
to a newline, and character sequences like “\A” will be translated to the
contents of custom AstroExpression variable @a. This switch will do nothing
when the program is in graphics mode.</p>

<p class=A>-</p>

<p class=Section><a name=extend>EXTENDED AND IMPROVED FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A list of improvements to existing features in Astrolog 7.50, such
as new things you can now do with old features that you couldn’t do before, or
ways that existing features work better than before:</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>1. Waxing/waning in more charts:</span> When the
aspect orb type is set to waxing/waning (-gx switch), certain charts that
display exact times of aspects will include whether the aspect is waxing/waning
next to them. The transit to transit times chart (-d switch), and the transit
to natal times chart (-t switch), will label waxing aspects with “x” and waning
with “n”. Similarly, the graphic calendar (-K -X switches) will label aspects with
“wax” or “wan” if there’s enough room to the left of the time in the calendar
boxes. Note that exact Conjunction and Opposition aspects are never waxing or
waning, so won’t be labeled as either.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>2. Extended eclipse detection:</span> Eclipse
detection (-Yu switch) has been extended to consider oppositions other than
Sun/Moon as eclipses or occultations too. Any opposition will be flagged as an
eclipse if the central body appears to overlap one body when viewed from the
vantage point of the other body.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>3. Transiting latitude crossings:</span> Astro-graph
chart latitude crossings when in transit to natal comparison chart mode (-L0
-rt switches) will now look at transit restrictions when deciding what objects
to include. For example, if only the Sun is enabled in transit restrictions,
and only the Moon is enabled in standard restrictions, then only transiting Sun
crossing natal Moon lines will be displayed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>4. See all chart slot data:</span> In the Windows
version, the “Charts #3 Through #6” dialog will now display the chart
information for all six chart slots in the dialog, to the right of the buttons
that allow one to open a file into or manually set these chart slots. This
makes it easy to see the contents of all chart slots together without having to
bring up a hexa-wheel.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>5. Progression rates labeled:</span> In the Windows
version, the Progressions dialog now labels the dropdown numbers in the Degrees
Per Day and Cusp Move Ratio fields. This makes it easier to see how to select
certain progression rates, such as Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>6. Signs labeled on map chart:</span> In the graphic world
map chart, when sign boundary lines are being drawn upon the map (-XC switch),
those areas will now also be labeled with the appropriate sign glyphs.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>7. Detailed planet wireframes:</span> When exporting
the graphic solar system orbit chart to wireframe file format, when a planet is
sufficiently zoomed in upon, it will be drawn as a full sphere instead of just
a small octahedron. When this is the case, Saturn and Uranus will also be drawn
with their rings, rotated and tilted at the proper angle. This makes the solar
system orbit chart similar to a 3D model of Astrolog’s telescope chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>8. Window resize memory:</span> Astrolog will remember
the most recent user selected window size. When switching from a chart type
that has a fixed size to a chart type that can be of any size, that user selected
size will be restored. This improved behavior can be seen in the X Windows version,
and in windows produced by the command line Windows version (#define WINCLI
enabled). It can also be seen in the standard Windows version when the Chart
Resizes Window and Window Resizes Chart settings are both enabled.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>9. Now charts for other slots:</span> The -n switch to
set the chart to the current moment now, may now also be invoked with
subswitches to set other chart slots. For example, -n2 will set chart slot #2
to the current moment now.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>10. Swiss Ephemeris updated:</span> Astrolog now uses
Swiss Ephemeris version 2.10.03, which includes updated Delta-T data along with
other adjustments and improvements.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>11. TZ database updated:</span> Astrolog’s time zone
change information has been updated to use TZ database version “2022c” (instead
of “2022a” which was used before). This new version has a few subtle
corrections and improvements to various areas in the world.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=change>PROGRAM CHANGES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A few changes that aren't new feature additions or bug fixes have
been made to Astrolog 7.50, which means certain old assumptions are no longer
valid. Most can be considered improvements, but they still change existing
behavior. A list of these follows (which aren't useful to be aware of unless
you have used previous versions of the program):</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>1. Display decan interface:</span> In the Windows
version, the “Standard Radix Chart Shows Decan Positions” checkbox in the Chart
Settings dialog has been removed. It’s been replaced with the new “Wheel Sign
Subdivision Type” dropdown, which allows selecting decans as well as other
types of division around wheel charts.</p>

<p class=A> <span class=X>2. Moons chart adjustment:</span> The graphic planetary
moons chart (-8 -X switches) now displays top down moon positions in the bottom
half of the chart relative to the central planet (i.e. potentially taking into
account light travel time to the viewing position). Before, the top down moon
positions would always be calculated relative to the planet the moons orbit,
which would only imperceptibly change when switching between apparent and true
positions, since moons are only a few light seconds away from their planet.
This change makes the front and top down views consistent with each other.
Similarly, the text mode planetary moons chart (-8 switch) will consider moon
positions relative to the viewing position, when calculating whether they’re in
the lead/follow/close/distant quadrants. If one prefers the old behavior, it
can be reproduced by turning on the true positions setting.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>3: Now command context:</span> The Windows “Chart for
now” command (-n switch) will now set the second or transiting chart slot to the
current moment, when in a relationship comparison bi-wheel mode.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=bug>BUG FIXES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are bugs or other issues with version 7.40, all of which have
been corrected in 7.50:</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>1. Menu checks misplaced:</span> In the Windows version,
selecting certain chart display menu commands wouldn’t place a check mark by
that command, but instead would often check an adjacent command instead. This
could be seen with the command “Moons Chart” on the Planetary Moons submenu,
the “Aspect List”, “Midpoint List”, and “Arabic Parts” commands on the Chart
menu, and the first five commands on the Graphics menu.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>2. Star color dialog bug:</span> In the Windows
version, the More Object Settings dialog would set the color for All Stars to
black, regardless of what the user put in that dialog field.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>3. Customization dialog bug:</span> In the Windows
version, in the Object Customization dialog, entering certain planets would
always be seen as one of the node/apsis points of the planet, instead of the
planet itself. For example, entering “Mar” (Mars by itself) would always be interpreted
as “Mar a” (for Mars apogee point), and would display as such when the dialog
was reopened.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>4. Extra latitude crossings:</span> In the text mode
Astro-graph chart with latitude crossings being displayed (-L0 switch), there
would be extra bogus latitude crossings displayed for the last enabled object
with an index beyond the house cusps. For example, extra latitude crossings
would be displayed if a Uranian or fixed star object were enabled.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>5. Sidereal rings bug:</span> In the graphic telescope
chart (-XZ switch), the angles of Saturn’s and Uranus’ rings would be wrong if
the sidereal zodiac was active.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>6. Earth telescope glitch:</span> In the graphic
telescope chart (-XZ switch), zooming in upon Earth when viewed from some other
body would list the phase of the Earth twice, in two separate informational
lines of text.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>7. Moons chart glitch:</span> The text mode planetary
moons chart (-8 switch) would list a planetary moon as Conjunct every other
planetary moon, if that planetary moon was set as the central object.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>8. Transit calendar display:</span> In non-Windows versions
of Astrolog, displaying a window with the graphic calendar containing transit
to natal aspects in it (-r0 -K -XA switches) would corrupt the natal data and
display bad results after the next screen update.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>9. Restriction bug:</span> The -YR switch to set the
restriction status of a range of objects wouldn’t properly enable Dwarf planet
or planetary moon category objects, because changing such objects wouldn’t also
turn on the setting that indicates at least some objects in those categories
are active.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>10. Save Settings bug:</span> The “Save Settings”
command (-od switch) wouldn’t save certain Display Format options correctly. It
would save “360 degrees” as “Hours and Minutes” and vice versa, and set the
other option when reloaded.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>11. Save Settings orb limitation:</span> The “Save
Settings” command (-od switch), would round orb settings to nearest whole
number. Fortunately, one could enter fractional orb settings in Astrolog's
dialogs, or specify them with command switches, or enter them manually into the
astrolog.as default settings file, and they would work that way.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>12. Custom star omission:</span> The -YU switch to
customize a star object slot with a different star from sefstars.txt, wouldn’t
automatically update the brightness of that object slot to be the new star.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>13. Thickness glitch:</span> When thicker lines are on
(-Xx switch), glyphs are normally drawn thin when at the smallest character
scale, to keep them legible. However, aspect glyphs (as well as the “--&gt;”
sign change markers in the graphic calendar chart) would remain thick, which
would be inconsistent as well as looking bad.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>14. Thickness printing bug:</span> In the Windows
version, printing when the thicker lines setting was on (-Xx switch) would
sometimes result in inconsistent line thicknesses, in places such as aspects
listed in the graphic calendar chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>15. Degree symbol glitch:</span> The degree symbol would
sometimes not display correctly when the output codepage was set to UTF8. One
would have to put -Ya1 on the command line to treat the input as IBM to get the
right character output, but such workarounds are no longer necessary.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>16. Customization bug:</span> The -Ye switch is
supposed to automatically produce a new display name to reflect the customized
object slot. However, command switches such as -YeOn would instead produce
garbage strings.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>17. Constellation display glitch:</span> The graphic
world map chart when displaying constellations (-XW -XF switches) would
occasionally have constellation lines cross the entire screen from left to
right, instead of disappearing on one side to and reappearing on the other.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>18. Command switch limitation:</span> The -q2 command
switch didn’t work as documented, because it would always set the contents of
the first chart slot instead of the second. Related command switches such as -qm2
would still work and set chart slot #2.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>19. Windows sequence bug:</span> The -Yq switch when
applied to the Windows version would sometimes result in a blank blue screen.
That’s because the -Yq switch casts and displays multiple charts in sequence,
which is designed for text mode charts displayed in a console, as opposed to
trying to display multiple graphics charts at once in a single window.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>20. Time subtraction bug:</span> The -+t switch when
given enough hours to back up to the previous day, would add a day instead.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>21. File parsing bug:</span> Tab characters in
astrolog.as or other command script files would be seen as a line break, which
would corrupt parsing of the file, and often end with an error about an
unexpected command switch. Tab characters are now treated like any other
whitespace.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=express>ASTROEXPRESSION UPDATES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>AstroExpressions or “Astrolog Expressions” are programmable
customizations that don’t require recompiling the program, and can be
considered an extended form of command switches. AstroExpression functions and
related command switches have been updated in version 7.50. This section can be
ignored if one doesn’t use this feature area.</p>

<p class=A>The following lists all new AstroExpression functions. The name of
each function is listed, followed by the type of its return value and the
expected types of its parameters (if any). Numbers will automatically be
converted to Integer or Real as needed.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>DMS:</span> Real(RealD, RealM, RealS). Degrees,
minutes, seconds. Returns a decimal number of degrees given a number of degrees,
minutes within the degree, and seconds within the minute. For example, “DMS 12
30 0” will return 12.5.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>LonDecan:</span> Real(Real). Decan transformation.
Transforms a zodiac position to its decan sign, like as done by the -3 switch.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>LonNavam:</span> Real(Real). Navamsa transformation.
Transforms a zodiac position to its Navamsa sign, like as done by the -9
switch.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>LonDwad:</span> Real(Real). Dwad transformation.
Transforms a zodiac position to its dwad sign, like as done by the -4 switch.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>LonTerm:</span> Int(Real, Int). Term determination.
Returns the object corresponding to the given zodiac position. Depending on the
integer parameter, this will be: 0=Decan ruler, 1=Chaldean decan, 2=Egyptian
term, 3=Ptolemaic term.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>_v3, _v31, _zv, _zf, _Yf, _XJJ, _X8:</span> Bool or
Int or Real. Program setting. This list of functions queries the Astrolog
setting that’s set with the identically named command switch. There are only a
few exceptions or alternate behaviors: Function _v31 is the optional parameter
to the -v3 switch. Function _XJJ is a Boolean for the -XJ switch setting, and
includes an extra “J” in its name to avoid a case insensitive name conflict
with _Xj.</p>

<p class=A>A few improvements, changes, or bug fixes have also been made in the
AstroExpression area:</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Decan division extended:</span> The ~v3 switch AstroExpression
has been extended to allow one to adjust the number of sign divisions and their
size. On entry, @w contains the size of the current division in degrees, @x
contains the sign index, @y contains the section index within the sign
(starting with 0), and @z contains the planet index to use to label the
section. Return value is ignored, although @w and @z can be changed to change
the size of the division and how to label it. If @z is between -1 and -12 the
section will be labeled with a sign instead of a planet, if @z is -100 or lower
it will be labeled with a number that’s 100 plus that number (e.g. -100 is 0,
-101 is 1, and so on), and if @z is between -13 and -99 then the section won’t
be labeled at all.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Extra star filtering extended:</span> The ~U and ~U0 switch
AstroExpressions have been extended, and now one to change the custom variables
@x through @z, to change the star or asteroid’s zodiac position longitude,
ecliptic latitude, velocity, and magnitude.</p>

<p class=B><span class=W>Object ordering extended:</span> The ~v switch AstroExpression
will now affect the order in which aspects are printed. For example, if ~v
places the Moon in order before the Sun, then aspects will be printed as &quot;Moon
Con Sun&quot; (and not “Sun Con Moon” as based on the default object ordering).</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>Astro-graph filtering bug:</span> The ~L switch
AstroExpression to filter the latitude crossing results of the astro-graph
chart (-L0 switch) didn’t work right, and wouldn’t display the events actually
selected by the AstroExpression.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>Object ordering limitation:</span> The ~v switch AstroExpression
wouldn’t affect the transit influence charts (-D and -T switches). These
transit charts now will take object order into account when sorting aspects by
object index.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>Transit filtering limitation:</span> The ~d and ~t switch
AstroExpressions for the transit to transit and transit to natal times charts
(-d and -t switches) would always set the recall chart (as accessed with “-i
set”) for an event, even if that event was filtered out by the AstroExpression.
This switch will now not set the recall chart until after the event has been
approved.</p>

<p class=B><span class=Y>Chart enumeration limitation:</span> The -Y5 and -5Y
switches which enumerate a chart weren’t easy to use, because they didn’t cast and
fill out all relevant chart slots before doing the enumeration. That required extra
work like using the -Yq switch on the command line to cast a chart first. These
switches now automatically cast charts before enumeration, allowing the
examples given for these switches to be easily run from the command line, or
pasted into the “Enter Command Line” dialog in Windows version.</p>
